r"""Fraction-field quotients are the divisible modules ``K / a``.

For ``K=QQ`` and ``a=6ZZ``, the class of ``1/3`` has additive order eighteen:
``18/3=6`` is the first multiple lying in ``6ZZ``.  The cyclic subgroup it
generates therefore has order eighteen even though ``QQ/6ZZ`` itself is
countably infinite.
