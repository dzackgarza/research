r"""Finite covering families as represented diagrams with chosen overlaps.

Two copies of the identity ``X -> X`` form a cover of ``X``.  Their overlap is
again ``X`` with identity legs, so this specimen exposes the members, the one
unordered pair of indices, its span, and the finite presentation functor without
requiring any topology-specific coverage condition.
