r"""Inverse systems as functors from the opposite of an indexing category.

For the chain ``0 <= 1``, the constant one-point diagram on its opposite is the
smallest inverse system.  Its variance is visible in the represented functor's
domain and its natural identity remains inside the inverse-system category.
