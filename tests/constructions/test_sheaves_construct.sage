r"""Sheaves as presheaves equipped with descent data for a coverage.

On the trivial coverage every presheaf satisfies descent canonically.  A
constant two-point presheaf on the one-object discrete site therefore gives the
smallest sheaf specimen while retaining the same presheaf functor and its
canonical descent datum.
