r"""Refining the standard atlas of ``P^1`` by the redundant chart ``U_0 ∩ U_1``.

``P^1_QQ = U_0 ∪ U_1`` with ``U_0 = Spec QQ[t]``, ``U_1 = Spec QQ[1/t]``.  Adding
``U_{01} = U_0 ∩ U_1`` as a third chart gives an affine cover refining the
standard one (send ``U_{01}`` to ``U_0``).  On a separated scheme Čech cohomology
of a quasi-coherent sheaf on any affine cover is sheaf cohomology (Hartshorne
III.4.5), so both atlases give ``H^0(O) = QQ`` and ``H^1(O) = 0``
(Hartshorne III.5.1).
