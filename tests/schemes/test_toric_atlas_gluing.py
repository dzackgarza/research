r"""The toric variety as the scheme glued from the charts of its maximal cones.

Values are Cox--Little--Schenck, *Toric Varieties*: the atlas and its gluing
are Thm. 3.1.5, the face localization presenting an overlap is Prop. 1.3.16,
and the identification of the intersection of all the charts with the dense
torus is the orbit-cone correspondence, Thm. 3.2.6.

Unverified: written by eye against the construction, not run.
