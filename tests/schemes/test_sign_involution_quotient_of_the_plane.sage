r"""The involution ``(x, y) -> (-x, -y)`` of ``A^2_Q`` as an affine ``C_2``-scheme.

Claims, each from the definitions: the fixed subscheme is cut out by ``x - (-x) = 2x`` and
``2y``, so it is the reduced origin; a polynomial is invariant exactly when all its monomials
have even degree, so ``Q[x, y]^{C_2} = Q[x^2, xy, y^2]``, which contains ``x^2`` and ``xy`` but not
``x``; the quotient ``Spec Q[x, y]^{C_2}`` is a surface (the invariant ring has the same
transcendence degree as ``Q[x, y]`` since ``Q[x, y]`` is integral over it); ``(x, y) -> x^2 + y^2``
is invariant, so it factors through the quotient map.
