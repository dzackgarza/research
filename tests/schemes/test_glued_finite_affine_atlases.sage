r"""Schemes glued from finite affine atlases, and their global functions.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01JA (gluing schemes from a finite family of charts
``U_i``, opens ``U_ij`` and isomorphisms ``phi_ij`` satisfying the cocycle condition on
triple overlaps) and Tag 01MM (the standard affine charts of ``P^n``).  Global functions
are the compatible families of chart functions (the sheaf condition), so gluing
``Spec QQ[x]`` to itself along ``D(x)`` by the identity gives ``Gamma(X, O) = QQ[x]``, and
by ``x -> 1/x`` gives ``Gamma(P^1, O) = QQ[x] cap QQ[1/x] = QQ`` (Hartshorne III.5.1).
