r"""Morphisms out of, and closed subschemes of, the line with a doubled origin.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01JA and Hartshorne, *Algebraic Geometry*, Example II.2.3.5:
a morphism out of a gluing is a family of chart morphisms agreeing on the overlaps,
and a closed subscheme is a family of closed subschemes of the charts agreeing on the
overlaps (closed immersions are local on the target).  On the line ``X`` with a doubled
origin (Example II.2.3.6), ``V(x)`` taken on both charts is the two origins, two rational
points; ``V(x - 1)`` on both charts is one point, since ``x = 1`` lies in the overlap
where the charts are identified; and the fixed locus of ``x -> -x`` is the two origins.
