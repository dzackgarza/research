r"""Archive reconciliation for quadratic versus bilinear 2-adic symmetries.

For the discriminant form of the rank-one lattice ``<8>``, the underlying
group is ``ZZ/8``.  Every unit whose square is one modulo eight preserves the
bilinear pairing, while preserving the quadratic refinement cuts the group to
``{+1,-1}``.  Thus the bilinear and quadratic orthogonal groups have orders
four and two respectively.  This is the rank-one case recorded in the
Miranda--Morrison 2-adic form rules used by the archived suite.
