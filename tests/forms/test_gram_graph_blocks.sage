r"""The weighted graph of a Gram tensor and the cuts between its consecutive blocks.

The Gram graph of a type-\((0,2)\) tensor \(G\) on a framed module has one vertex per
framing position and an edge \(\{i,j\}\) weighted \(G_{ij}\) whenever \(G_{ij}\ne0\).  A
cut is a position \(k\) such that the first \(k\) positions are a union of connected
components, so that \(G\) is block diagonal with blocks \([0,k)\) and \([k,n)\).

For \(A_2 \oplus A_1\) (Gram \(\operatorname{diag}(\begin{smallmatrix}-2&1\\1&-2\end{smallmatrix}, -2)\))
the only off-diagonal edge is \(\{0,1\}\), of weight 1, and the only cut is at 2.  For the
Gram \(\begin{pmatrix}-2&0&1\\0&-2&0\\1&0&-2\end{pmatrix}\) the components are \(\{0,2\}\)
and \(\{1\}\), which are not intervals, so there is no cut.
