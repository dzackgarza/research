r"""A span is an object, and it owns its pushout.

A span :math:`A\leftarrow C\to B` is an apex with one arrow to each of two
objects, so it is a cone over the discrete diagram on those two and needs no
shape vocabulary beyond the one the diagram layer already has.  Being an
object, it has an apex, two legs, a diagram, and a colimit it asks its
category for.
