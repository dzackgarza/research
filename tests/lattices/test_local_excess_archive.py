r"""Conway--Sloane local excess/oddity formula retained from the archive suite.

For odd ``p`` the local excess is ``sum n_q(q-1)+4k_p`` modulo eight; for
``p=2`` the oddity is ``sum t_q+4k_2``.  Here ``k_p`` counts antisquare
constituents.  The formula is recomputed from the canonical Jordan tuples and
compared with the owned genus value.
