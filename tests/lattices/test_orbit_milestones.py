r"""The three verification milestones of the indefinite orbit program.

Each milestone fixes a lattice and asks for the orbit data of one Witt index.

Milestone 1, ``h = 1``: ``E10 = U + E8``, the even unimodular Lorentzian
lattice ``II_{1,9}`` (Conway--Sloane, *Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups*,
ch. 26).  Its single cusp, the reduction ``e^perp/e = E8`` and the Eichler
transvections of the unipotent radical are asserted in
``test_cusp_lattices.py`` and ``test_parabolic_induction.py``; what is added
here is the Levi half of ``1 -> U_I -> P_I -> M_I -> 1``, namely that the
cusp stabilizer acts nontrivially on the reduction.  That action is onto
``O(E8)``, which is a theorem and not something a method body establishes.

Milestone 2, ``h = 2``: ``N = U + U(2) + E8(-2)``, the anti-invariant lattice
of the Enriques involution, whose isotropic lines and planes are the zero- and
one-dimensional boundary components of the Enriques period space
(Dutour Sikiric--Hulek, arXiv:2302.01679, classify the arithmetic subgroups
acting on it).  The incidence between the two ranks is the Tits building.

Milestone 3, equivariant: the K3 lattice ``Lambda = 3U + 2E8(-1)`` with the
Enriques involution.  The invariant and anti-invariant decomposition, the
gluing subgroup and the index ``2^10`` are asserted in
``test_centralizer_gluing.py``; what is added here is the intersection of the
centralizer ``O(Lambda, iota)`` with the stabilizer of a polarization, which
is the group acting on the polarized period domain.
