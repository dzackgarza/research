r"""Nikulin's classification table and its smallest realization routes.

A K3 surface with a non-symplectic involution has invariant lattice determined
up to isometry by \((r, a, \delta)\): the rank, the length of the discriminant
group, and Nikulin's parity invariant.  There are 75 such triples, and each
invariant lattice is hyperbolic, of signature \((1, r-1)\).

The catalogue is a literal 75-row source table.  Runtime construction here
uses the smallest rows covering the one-block and orthogonal-sum branches;
the nontrivial gluing route has its dedicated A1^8 specimen in the focused
two-elementary tests.  This avoids reconstructing all 75 lattices merely to
recheck source data.
