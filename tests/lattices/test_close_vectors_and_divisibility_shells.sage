r"""Lattice points near a rational target, and shells of fixed square and divisibility.

- In \(A_2\) (Gram \(\begin{pmatrix}-2&1\\1&-2\end{pmatrix}\)) the target
  \(t=\tfrac34e_0+\tfrac14e_1\) has \(q(0-t) = q(e_0+e_1-t) = -\tfrac78\) and
  \(q(e_0-t) = -\tfrac38\); every other lattice point has \(|q(x-t)|>1\).  So the points
  with \(q(x-t)\ge-1\) are \(0, e_0, e_0+e_1\).
- In \(\mathbf Z^2\) the centre \((\tfrac12,\tfrac12)\) of the unit square is at square
  distance \(\tfrac12\) from each of its four corners and further from every other point.
- \(D_4 = \{x\in\mathbf Z^4:\sum x_i\text{ even}\}\) with the negated form: its vectors of
  square \(-4\) are \((\pm2,0,0,0)\) and \((\pm1,\pm1,\pm1,\pm1)\), and each pairs evenly with
  every vector of \(D_4\), so all 24 have divisibility 2; the 24 roots have divisibility 1,
  since each root pairs to \(\pm1\) with another root.
