r"""Archived lattice similarities on the live twist/isometry construction.

A similarity of scale ``a`` from ``L`` to ``M`` is an isometry ``L(a) -> M``.
The archived API exposed both the existence predicate and the actual morphism.
The hyperbolic plane and its scale-two twist distinguish this from ordinary
isometry because their determinants differ by a factor of four.
