r"""Archived definite-genus representatives and mass on the live genus owner.

The archived integral-lattice genus object exposed a representative, all class
representatives, class number, determinant, and Smith--Minkowski--Siegel mass.
For the even unimodular ``E8`` genus there is one class, so its mass is exactly
the reciprocal of the full orthogonal-group order.
