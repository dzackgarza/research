r"""The ten null rays of the split rank-six cell have stabilizer W(D5).

Write a_i=e_i+f and b_i=sum_{j!=i} e_j+2f in I_{5,1}.
Distinct pairings are -1 except b(a_i,b_i)=-2. Thus every pairing
permutation permutes five pairs and exchanges selected pairs. The five
orthogonal vectors a_i-b_i have square 4; their reflections exchange the
respective pairs. Each vector is congruent to sum(e_i)+f modulo 2, so
exactly the products of an even number of these half-integral reflections
are integral. Hence the lattice stabilizer is (C2)^4 semidirect S5,
of order 16*120=1920. It preserves every one of the ten given positions.
