r"""A3 pairing forms have one least representative under reindexing.

The negative A3 Cartan matrix has diagonal -2, adjacent entries 1 and
nonadjacent entries 0. Its lexicographically least reindexing puts the
two nonadjacent vertices first, giving the displayed matrix. This is
the minimum of a finite orbit in a total order, independent of its seed.
The construction uses the symmetric-group set of forms and the existing
finite-orbit and ordered-minimum constructions.
