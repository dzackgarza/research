r"""Source-backed Voronoi geometry retained from the archived mathematics suite.

Conway--Sloane, *Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups*, chapter 21: the
Voronoi cell of the square lattice is the half-cube, and the Voronoi cell of
``A2`` is a regular hexagon.  The live implementation already owns the exact
polyhedron and relevant vectors; these specimens retain the literature facts
that were not present in the current regression surface.
