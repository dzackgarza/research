r"""A quotient of a presented algebra is one quotient of the same presentation.

For ``A = P/I`` the algebra ``A/(J)`` is ``P/(I + J~)``, where ``J~`` lifts the
new relations to ``P``.  Cutting the line ``x = 0`` out of the union of the two
axes ``xy = 0`` leaves the ``y``-axis, and the result is presented over the same
polynomial ring and the same scalars as the first cut, not stacked on top of it
as a second quotient object.
