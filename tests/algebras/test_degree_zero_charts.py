r"""Standard charts of a projective spectrum, read as degree-zero parts.

Localizing a graded ring at homogeneous elements grades the result over the
integers by ``deg(a/s) = deg(a) - deg(s)``, and the degree-zero part of ``S_f``
is the coordinate ring of the standard open ``D_+(f)`` of ``Proj S``.  For the
polynomial ring on three variables these are the three affine planes covering
the projective plane, and the restriction between two localizations cuts down
to the overlap map between their charts.
