r"""Subgroups of $S_4$ cut out by a predicate, as a kernel, or as a stabilizer.

The even permutations form $A_4$, of order $4!/2 = 12$; it contains the
$3$-cycles and no transposition.  The sign map $S_4 \to C_2$ is determined
by sending the transposition $(1\,2)$ and the $4$-cycle $(1\,2\,3\,4)$ (both
odd) to the generator, and its kernel is again $A_4$, which is nonabelian
($(1\,2\,3)(1\,2)(3\,4) \ne (1\,2)(3\,4)(1\,2\,3)$).  The stabilizer of the
point $4$ is $S_3$, of order $6$, and $A_4 \cap S_3 = A_3$ has order $3$.
The centralizer of $(1\,2)(3\,4)$ is the dihedral group of order $8$ that
contains it, since its class has $3$ elements and $24 / 3 = 8$.
