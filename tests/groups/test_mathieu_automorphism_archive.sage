r"""The Mathieu ``M12`` automorphism group retained from the archive.

The *Atlas of Finite Groups* lists ``|M12| = 95040`` and outer automorphism
multiplicity ``2``.  Since ``M12`` is simple and centerless, conjugation
identifies ``M12`` with its inner automorphism subgroup, so the full
automorphism group has order ``190080`` and the inner subgroup has index two.
