r"""The one-object category $BS_3$, whose arrows are the elements of $S_3$.

$BG$ has one object $*$ and $\mathrm{Mor}(*, *) = G$, with composition the
group law, identity the unit and every arrow invertible.  So in $BS_3$ the
arrow $(1\,2)$ composed with itself is the identity, the inverse of
$(1\,2\,3)$ is $(1\,3\,2)$, and composing $(1\,2)$ with $(1\,2\,3)$ gives
the arrow of their product.  This is the definition of $BG$.
