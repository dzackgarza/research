r"""Precision-aware arithmetic on represented adic completions.

The completion is the inverse limit.  A private finite approximation may prove
inequality, but agreement at its selected precision is never promoted to exact
equality.  Exact source expressions and maintained exact/lazy series engines
retain stronger information when it is genuinely available.
