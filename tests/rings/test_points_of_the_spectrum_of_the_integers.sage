r"""The points of ``Spec Z``: the generic point ``(0)`` and the closed points ``(p)``.

``Z`` is a Dedekind domain of dimension one, so a nonzero prime ``(p)`` has height
one and a closed point (its closure ``Spec F_p`` has dimension zero), while ``(0)``
has height zero and is dense (its closure is all of ``Spec Z``, of dimension one).
The generic point specializes to every closed point and no closed point
specializes to another.  The local ring ``Z_(p)`` is a discrete valuation ring,
hence regular with embedding dimension one, and the order of vanishing at ``(p)``
is the ``p``-adic valuation: ``ord_5(50) = 2`` and ``ord_5(3) = 0``.  The residue
field at ``(5)`` is ``F_5`` and at ``(0)`` is ``Q``.

``Z/6`` has exactly two primes, ``(2)`` and ``(3)``, so its spectrum has two points.
