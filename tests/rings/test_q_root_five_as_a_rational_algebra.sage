r"""``Q(sqrt 5)`` as a two-dimensional ``Q``-algebra, and multiplication by ``sqrt 5``.

As a ``Q``-algebra ``Q(sqrt 5) = Q[a]/(a^2 - 5)``.  Multiplication by ``sqrt 5`` is a
``Q``-linear endomorphism whose trace and determinant are the field trace ``0``
and norm ``-5`` (the trace and norm of an element are those of its multiplication
map, by definition).  A quadratic field is Galois, so it is its own normal
closure, with Galois group of order two.
