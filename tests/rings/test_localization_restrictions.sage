r"""Restriction between localizations, and its composition.

Localization is universal among maps out of ``R`` inverting a set of scalars,
so for ``S`` inside ``T`` there is exactly one map ``S^{-1}R -> T^{-1}R`` over
``R``.  Uniqueness makes these maps compose, which is the cocycle condition an
affine cover needs before any sheaf is glued on it.  Localizing a module along
the same restriction gives the map from a section to its restriction, and at a
prime to its germ.
