r"""A commutative ring is an algebra over any ring mapping to it.

Every ring is uniquely a ``Z``-algebra, since ``Z`` is initial: ``Z/6`` is a
``Z``-algebra whose structure map sends ``7`` to ``1``, and ``Q`` is a ``Z``-algebra.
``Q[x]`` is already a ``Q``-algebra and is its own ``Q``-algebra.  There is no ring
map ``Q -> Z`` (the image of ``1/2`` would be an inverse of ``2`` in ``Z``), so ``Z``
is not a ``Q``-algebra.
