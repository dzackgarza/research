r"""Height of a prime, and the order of vanishing at a prime of height one.

The height of ``p`` is the codimension of the closed set it defines, so in the
plane the origin has height two while the line ``x = 0`` has height one.  At a
prime of height one the local ring is a discrete valuation ring, and the order
of vanishing of a function there is the multiplicity of the uniformizer in it:
``x^3(x-1)`` vanishes to order three along ``x = 0`` and not at all along
``x = 1``, and ``50`` vanishes to order two at the prime ``5`` of the integers.

These are the numbers a Weil divisor is written with, which is why they are
asked of the point rather than of the ring.
