Introduction

   As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize industries,
   it's being used in a wide range of applications. Code generation is one
   of the prominent applications. LLMs have been used to generate code
   snippets, documentation, and even entire programs. As an emergent
   field, there are still many challenges, moreover, there are three key
   challenges stand out:
    1. Hallucination: LLMs may generate syntactically valid but logically
       incorrect code (e.g., using non-existent APIs or ignoring edge
       cases).
    2. Knowledge Cutoffs: Models are limited by their training data cutoff
       dates, lacking awareness of newer developments such as updated
       library versions or frameworks. This limitation is particularly
       significant in programming, where API changes occurring after the
       training cutoff date are not reflected in the LLM's responses.
    3. Context Length: LLMs have a limited context window, which can be
       problematic when generating code for large projects or long
       functions. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect code
       generation.
       Furthermore, as studied in [Loss in middle], the performance of
       LLMs will decrease when the context length is too long.

   To alleviate such challenges, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has
   emerged as an effective solution to address these limitations. A high
   level RAG pipeline adapted from here is shown as follows:

Understanding RAG for Code Generation

   RAG operates through two primary components:
     * A retriever that searches and extracts relevant information from
       knowledge sources
     * A generator that processes this information through LLMs to produce
       refined outputs

   This architecture provides additional context for LLMs to reason with,
   reducing hallucinations and mitigating knowledge cutoff limitations by
   enabling access to up-to-date information. An RAG augmented LLM
   reasoning framework can be realized as follows(adapted from here):
   Zoom image will be displayed

   Despite these advantages, context length remains challenging. When
   content exceeds certain lengths, LLM processing capabilities decline
   significantly. Traditional chunking strategies work well for text
   documents but fall short with source code.

The Problem with Traditional Chunking for Code

   Consider this simple C++ example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void greet(string name) {
    cout << "Hello, " << name << endl;
}
int main() {
    greet("Alice");
    greet("Bob");

    return 0;
}

   If we apply traditional chunking (e.g., Chunk Size = 50, with 25
   overlap)
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
chunk_size = 50
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=chunk_size,  chunk_ove
rlap=25, length_function = len)
chunks = text_splitter.split_text(code)

   We might get:
+----------------------+------------------------------------+
|        Chunk         |              Content               |
+----------------------+------------------------------------+
| 1                    | #include <iostream>                |
|                      | using namespace std;               |
|______________________|____________________________________|
| 2                    | void greet(string name) {          |
|______________________|____________________________________|
| 3                    | cout << "Hello, " << name << endl; |
|                      | }                                  |
|______________________|____________________________________|
| 4                    | int main() {                       |
|                      | greet("Alice");                    |
|______________________|____________________________________|
| 5                    | greet("Alice");                    |
|                      | greet("Bob");                      |
|______________________|____________________________________|
| 6                    | greet("Bob");                      |
|                      | return 0;                          |
|                      | }                                  |
+----------------------+------------------------------------+

   The problem is clear: traditional chunking disregards code structure,
   producing malformed fragments lacking proper syntax closure.

AST-Based Chunking: A Better Approach

   To overcome this limitation, we can use Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
   representations of code. An AST is a tree-like structure representing
   the syntactic structure of source code. AST-based chunking splits code
   at meaningful boundaries -- such as function definitions or control
   structures -- ensuring each chunk remains syntactically valid.

   For instance, the expression "a = b + c" can be represented as a tree
   where the assignment operator (=) is the root node, with variable `a'
   as the left child and the addition expression (b + c) as the right
   child.

Implementing AST-Based Chunking with Tree-Sitter

   Tree-sitter is a powerful parser that enables programmatic analysis of
   source code:

Setting Up Tree-Sitter

    1. Install the Tree-Sitter Package

pip3 install tree_sitter
    1. Add Language Grammars

pip3 install tree-sitter-cpp

Using Tree-Sitter

   After compiling the library, we can parse code:
from tree_sitter import Language, Parser
import tree_sitter_cpp
CPP_LANGUAGE = Language(tree_sitter_cpp.language())
parser = Parser(CPP_LANGUAGE)
code = '''
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void greet(string name) {
    cout << "Hello, " << name << endl;
}
int main() {
    greet("Alice");
    greet("Bob");

    return 0;
}
'''
tree = parser.parse(bytes(code, "utf8"))

   Explore the parsed tree structure:
root = tree.root_node
for child in root.children:
    print(child.type, " -> ", code[child.start_byte:child.end_byte])

   Outputs:
preproc_include  ->  #include <iostream>
using_declaration  ->  using namespace std;
function_definition  ->  void greet(string name) {
    cout << "Hello, " << name << endl;
}
function_definition  ->  int main() {
    greet("Alice");
    greet("Bob");

    return 0;
}

Chunking Code with Tree-Sitter

   Now for the main event -- chunking code by extracting semantically
   meaningful subtrees:
terminal = [
    'if_statement',
    'while_statement',
    'for_statement',
    'for_range_loop',
]
def extract_subtree(subtree_root):
    queue = [subtree_root]
    subtree_nodes = []
    ignore_types = ["\n"]
    while queue:
        current_node = queue.pop(0)
        for child in current_node.children:
            child_type = str(child.type)
            if child_type not in ignore_types:
                queue.append(child)
            if child_type in terminal:
                subtree_nodes.append(child)
    return subtree_nodes
def extract_subtrees(tree):
    root = tree.root_node
    all_subtrees = []
    queue = [root]
    while queue:
        current_node = queue.pop(0)
        if str(current_node.type) in terminal:
            all_subtrees.append(current_node)
        else:
            subtree = extract_subtree(current_node)
            all_subtrees.extend(subtree)
            children = [x for x in current_node.children]
            queue.extend(children)
    return all_subtrees
subtrees = extract_subtrees(tree)

   We've defined terminal node types as our chunking boundaries. The
   extraction process traverses the AST and identifies these terminal
   nodes.

Converting AST Nodes to Text for Embeddings

   Convert nodes back to source text:
src_texts = []
for subtree in subtrees:
    if code[subtree.start_byte:subtree.end_byte] not in src_texts:
        src_texts.append(code[subtree.start_byte:subtree.end_byte])

   Generate embeddings for each code chunk:
import torch
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")from transf
ormers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Salesforce/codet5p-110m-embedding", t
rust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("Salesforce/codet5p-110m-embedding", trust_rem
ote_code=True, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map={"":0})
model.config.model_type = 't5'
model = model.to_bettertransformer()
model.eval()
def get_embedding(texts, max_length=2048):
    inputs = tokenizer(texts, return_tensors="pt", max_length=max_length, paddin
g='max_length', truncation=True).to(device)
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        return outputs.cpu().detach()
embeddings = []
for src_text in src_texts:
    embedding = get_embedding(src_text)
    embeddings.append(embedding)

Storing and Retrieving Code Chunks

   After generating embeddings for each code chunk, we need an efficient
   way to store and retrieve them. We'll use hnswlib, a fast approximate
   nearest neighbor search library that works well with high-dimensional
   vectors like our code embeddings.
import hnswlib
idlist = list(range(0, len(embeddings)))
dim = embeddings[0].shape[-1]
index = hnswlib.Index(space='cosine', dim=dim)
index.init_index(max_elements=len(embeddings), ef_construction=200, M=16)
index.add_items(src_emb, idlist)
# emb is the embedding of our query code chunk
# k=5 returns 5 most similar code chunks
labels, distances = index.knn_query(emb, 5)

   This creates a searchable index for our code embeddings and enables
   efficient retrieval of semantically similar code chunks by calculating
   cosine similarity between vector representations. The labels variable
   contains the indices of the most similar chunks, while distances
   indicates how close each match is to our query. In practical
   applications, we can then use these retrieved code chunks to enhance
   our prompt for code generation.

Limitation

   Careful readers might have already noticed that lengthy source code can
   exceed the context length limitations of both encoder and generation
   LLMs. This is a valid concern. A practical solution can be employing a
   sliding window strategy followed by averaging during the embedding
   encoding stage. Additionally, after initial retrieval, the code can be
   further segmented base on AST, followed by re-ranking the segments
   based on their relevance to the query (or segmented query).

Enhancing Code Chunk Generation

   In our example, we demonstrated using CodeT5 for embedding generation
   after AST-based chunking, implementing the retriever component of the
   RAG pipeline. This approach can be further enhanced by expanding our
   subtree extraction logic to include additional terminal node types and
   nearby code fragments. This extension would capture more contextually
   meaningful code chunks while maintaining syntactic validity. We left
   this as an exercise for the reader to explore.

Improving Retrieval Performance

   The retrieval process can be optimized using advanced techniques like
   BM25 or hybrid retrievers. For practical implementation details, the
   AWS Science team has open-sourced a comprehensive evaluation framework
   at auto-rag-eval. Using their approach, we can implement BM25-based
   retrieval to fetch the most relevant code chunks for any given prompt,
   significantly improving the quality of code generation.

Optimizing Storage with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base

   Maintaining a comprehensive index of code chunks can be inefficient and
   computationally expensive. Thus, we can leverage Amazon Bedrock's
   Knowledge Base (KB) for efficient storage and retrieval. A key
   advantage of AWS KB lies in its seamless integration with LLMs deployed
   on Amazon SageMaker. This tight integration empowers users to query the
   RAG-augmented LLM through both UI and APIs, facilitating the generation
   of enhanced code snippets. For implementation details, refer to AWS's
   open-source repository: Bedrock Access Gateway and also the official
   walkthrough here.

Conclusion

   By leveraging the Abstract Syntax Tree for code chunking, we've
   addressed a key challenge in applying RAG to code generation tasks.
   This approach preserves the syntactic integrity of code fragments,
   ensuring each chunk remains valid and meaningful. The methodology can
   be extended to generate chunks based on custom criteria, potentially
   improving generated code quality and reducing hallucinations.
