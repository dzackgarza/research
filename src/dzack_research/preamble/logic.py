r"""Predicates whose truth can be asked without coercing uncertainty to false.

The preamble uses ordinary booleans when a proposition is already decided.
When a mathematical relation is not decided at construction time, it returns
a :class:`Predicate`.  ``ask(P)`` evaluates the predicate; if the available
exact/certified procedures still do not decide it, the answer is Sage's
``Unknown``.

A predicate here is a closed proposition ``R(x)``: the value
``chi_R(x)`` of the characteristic morphism ``chi_R : X -> Delta[1]`` of a
relation ``R`` on a set ``X`` at a point ``x``, whose computation is deferred.
``ask`` is the knowledge question about that value, so its codomain is
``True | False | Unknown`` (`DEF-06`).
