            Localization is universal among ring maps out of ``R`` that invert
            ``S``.  So whenever ``T^{-1}R`` already inverts every element of
            ``S``, exactly one map ``S^{-1}R -> T^{-1}R`` respects the two maps
            from ``R``, and it sends ``a/s`` to ``a`` times the inverse of ``s``.
            Uniqueness is what makes these maps compose: for ``S`` inside ``T``
            inside ``U`` the composite of the two restrictions is the single
            restriction from ``S`` to ``U``.

            On spectra this is the inclusion of distinguished opens
            ``D(fg) <= D(f)``, so sheaf restriction on an affine scheme is this
            map and nothing further.  Taking ``T`` to be the complement of a
            prime gives the map from a section to its germ.

            The same open arises the other way, by localizing the chart
            ``S^{-1}R`` itself at ``g``.  Then the target's source is this ring
            rather than ``R``, and the map over it is that localization's own
            map, which the two constructions of ``D(fg)`` share.

            Between two prime localizations the containment ``S <= T`` is
            ``R \\ q <= R \\ p``, that is ``p <= q``, so ``R_q -> R_p`` exists
            exactly when ``p`` generalizes ``q``: the germ at a point maps
            to the germ at any point whose closure contains it. These
            presentations do not select finite generating sets, so the
            containment is decided on the primes rather than on inverted

            ``(s_i)`` of ``S`` over ``R`` along ``f`` with a framing ``(m_j)`` of

            construction there, so it has no public framing to ask; the basis
            comes from how ``S`` is realized, which only ``S`` may read.

            Implementers are ring owners: this default, and the owners whose

            unique for each ``s``.  ``None`` states that no basis along this
            ``f`` is selected, never that ``Res_f(S)`` is not free.

            The default is the basis of ``S`` as an ``R``-algebra framed over

        A module over this ring registers the action of this ring on its
        elements, and the host's coercion model finds that action for ``r*m``.
        It finds it only when this method defers, and this method cannot defer
        whenever this ring can convert the other element: the line below would
        then multiply in this ring and answer in it, so ``3`` times the identity
        of the Gaussian field would be the rational three rather than the
        Gaussian three.  A number field, a polynomial ring and every other
        algebra over this ring holds such elements -- the ones this ring already
        names.

        So the scalar action is taken here, on the element's own parent, before
        the conversion is tried.  It is the same operation the registered action
        performs, reached on the one route the coercion model does not see.
