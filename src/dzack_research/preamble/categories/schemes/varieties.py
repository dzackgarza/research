"""Owned varieties, curves, and surfaces.

A variety over ``S`` is an integral separated scheme of finite type over
``S``; a curve and a surface are the varieties of relative dimension one and
two.  Constructors which establish those hypotheses place the result in the
corresponding full subcategory; membership never recomputes them afterwards.

Projectivity, properness, smoothness, the K3 condition and the del Pezzo
condition are properties, so they are axioms on these categories, and
``Surfaces(k).Projective()`` is the category Sage computes from the axiom
rather than a class of its own (``CAT-17``, ``CAT-27``).
