r"""Projective complete intersections with their selected regular sequence.

A complete intersection ``X = V_+(f_1, ..., f_r) <= P^n_R`` is a closed
subscheme of projective space together with the homogeneous equations cutting
it out, where ``f_1, ..., f_r`` is a regular sequence.  It is constructed by
the closed-subscheme construction of ``P^n_R`` with the placement
``ProjectiveCompleteIntersections(R)``; the category adds no datum of its own:
its codimension, multidegree and ambient are read off the equations and the
inclusion.

The base change ``X_{R'} = X x_{Spec R} Spec R'`` along ``g: R -> R'`` is the
closed subscheme of ``P^n_{R'}`` cut out by the base-changed equations, and it
is constructed as an object of ``FiberProductSchemes(R')``: its left projection
is ``X_{R'} -> X`` and its right projection is the structure morphism.
