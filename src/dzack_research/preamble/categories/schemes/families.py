r"""Relative affine families and their fibres over a local base.

An affine family ``X -> Spec T`` presented by equations over ``T`` is the
affine ``T``-scheme ``Spec T[x_1,...,x_n]/(f_1,...,f_r)``: an object of
``Sch/T`` is a scheme together with its structure morphism to ``Spec T``, and
that structure morphism is the family.  Fibres are fibre products along
morphisms into ``Spec T``, flatness and the relative nonsmooth locus are the
affine scheme's own operations, and the slice object is
``Schemes(T).as_slice_object(X)``.  Nothing here is a second object beside
the scheme.
