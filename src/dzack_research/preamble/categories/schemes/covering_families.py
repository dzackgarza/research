r"""Scheme-facing ingress for finite covering families of locally ringed spaces.

The mathematical object is owned by :class:`CoveringFamilies`.  This module
only translates the convenient chart/embedding/overlap input used by locally
ringed spaces into arrows of the slice over the covered space.  It deliberately
defines no second covering-family, overlap, or refinement record.
