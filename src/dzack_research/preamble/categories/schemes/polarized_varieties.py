    - ``X = P^n``: ``g_{2j} = alpha^j`` and ``alpha^j cup alpha^r =
      alpha^{j+r}`` (Hatcher, *Algebraic Topology*, Thm. 3.19), so ``g_k``
      goes to ``m^power g_{k + 2 power}``.
    - ``X`` a smooth complete intersection of dimension ``n`` and degree
      ``d``: by the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem ``g_k = i^* alpha^{k/2}`` for
      even ``k < n``, and by Poincare duality ``g_k`` for even ``k > n`` is
      dual to the generator of ``H_{2n-k}(X) = H_{2n-k}(P^N)`` (Dimca,
      *Singularities and Topology of Hypersurfaces*, Ch. 5, §3; Lazarsfeld,
      *Positivity I*, 3.1.17).  The projection formula makes cup with
      ``i^* alpha`` the identity on these generators away from the middle
      degree, and ``(i^* alpha)^n = d g_{2n}``.  So ``g_k`` goes to
      ``m^power g_{k + 2 power}`` when ``k`` and ``k + 2 power`` lie on one
      side of ``n``, and to ``d m^power g_{k + 2 power}`` when ``k < n <

    A group of rank zero at either end gives the zero map.  The middle group
    ``H^n`` of an even-dimensional complete intersection has a basis that no
    represented class identifies with ``i^* alpha^{n/2}``, so a map into or
