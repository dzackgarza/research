r"""The affine quotient of a group action and the sections it acts on, as functors.

For a ``G``-scheme ``X`` the scheme ``Spec(Gamma(X, O_X)^G)`` is universal
for invariant morphisms from ``X`` to affine schemes.  This is the affine
quotient, without asserting a quotient universal among all schemes.  Its
definition and the section action belong to ``GObjects(G, Schemes(R))``;
the selected invariant computation is supplied by affine ``X = Spec(A)``.
This module supplies the functorial arrows and the selected base-change
comparison.

Given an equivariant ``f: X -> Y``, the composite ``q_Y f`` is invariant
because ``f`` intertwines the two actions and ``q_Y`` is invariant, so it
factors uniquely through ``q_X`` as ``f/G: X/G -> Y/G``.  Uniqueness of that
factorization is what makes ``X -> X/G`` functorial: it forces
``(g f)/G = (g/G)(f/G)`` and ``id/G = id`` without either being computed
separately.  An equivariant automorphism of ``X`` therefore descends to an
automorphism of ``X/G``, which is how a symmetry compatible with the group
action reaches the quotient.

Sections go the other way.  Taking the coordinate algebra of an affine
``G``-scheme with the action pullback induces on it is contravariant, and
lands in the ``R[G]``-modules; the invariants of that module are the sections
of the quotient, which is the statement the two functors make together.

The regime is the one the invariant algebra is constructed in.  For a scalar
field extension, both invariant algebras can be constructed independently and
the canonical base-change comparison is represented below.  It is promoted to
an isomorphism only under the Reynolds hypothesis that the finite group order
is invertible in the target field.  No such assertion is made for arbitrary
base change, and in residue characteristic dividing the group order this
constant-group comparison is deliberately not used as a substitute for
group-scheme geometry.

    The original affine category adapter retains its affine source category;
    the common action category supplies the general source explicitly.

    The sections of an affine ``G``-scheme ``X = Spec(B)`` carry one
    ``G``-action, and contravariance fixes which one.  Pullback composes the
    wrong way round, ``sigma_g^* sigma_h^* = sigma_{hg}^*``, so the left
    action is ``g . b = sigma_{g^{-1}}^*(b)`` and nothing else.

    This is the linearization of ``pi_* O_X`` along the structure morphism
    ``pi: X -> Spec(R)``, read as an ``R``-module with its ``G``-action.  For
    a cyclic cover it is where the grading of the cover algebra becomes
    representation theory: the deck generator multiplies the summand
    ``A z^i`` by ``zeta^{-i}``, so each summand is an eigen-submodule and the
    invariants are the summand of character one, which is what descends to
    the quotient.  Evaluating at a fixed point of the action is a morphism of
    this category, so the fibre over a fixed point inherits the action, and
    over a ramification point of a cover it is where the deck action stops
    being free.

    An equivariant ``f: X -> Y`` pulls sections back, and ``f^*`` is a
    morphism of ``R[G]``-modules because ``f`` intertwines the two actions.
