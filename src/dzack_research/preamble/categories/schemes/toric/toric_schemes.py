r"""Toric varieties: schemes built from a fan in a cocharacter lattice.

A toric variety is a normal separated variety \(X\) containing a torus
\(T_N\) as a dense open subset, with the torus action on itself extending to
\(X\).  Every such \(X\) of finite type comes from a fan \(\Sigma\) in
\(N_{\mathbb R}\) (Cox--Little--Schenck, *Toric Varieties*, Cor. 3.1.8), and
the fan is the datum this layer constructs from.

Membership is a fact about how the object was built, never a recognition of
ray coordinates: an object of ``ToricSchemes(k)`` carries its fan, and the
standard identifications (``P^n``, ``P^1 x P^1``, a Hirzebruch surface, a
weighted projective space) are decided by an isomorphism of fans, which by
CLS Thm 3.3.4 is an isomorphism of the varieties.

The affine charts are constructed here, not read off a backend: the chart of
a cone is ``Spec`` of the semigroup algebra of \(S_\sigma=\sigma^\vee\cap M\),
and a face inclusion \(\tau\preceq\sigma\) is realized as the distinguished
open of the chart of \(\sigma\) at one monomial (CLS Prop. 1.3.16).  The
variety is the scheme glued from the charts of the maximal cones along the
transitions of their pairwise intersections, so what a session receives is an
owned glued scheme; Sage's ``ToricVariety`` stays as the private space the
fan-morphism construction computes in.

A transition is the content the charts do not already carry.  Two charts meet
in the chart of \(\gamma=\sigma\cap\tau\), presented on one side as
\(k[S_\sigma][1/\chi^{m_\sigma}]\) and on the other as
\(k[S_\tau][1/\chi^{m_\tau}]\).  Sending each chosen semigroup generator of
\(S_\tau\) to its character on the overlap gives a morphism into the whole
chart \(U_\tau\) that inverts \(\chi^{m_\tau}\), and the universal property of
the localization factors it uniquely through the open.  Reading a character of
\(S_\gamma\) inside \(k[S_\sigma][1/\chi^{m_\sigma}]\) uses
\(S_\gamma=S_\sigma+\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}(-m_\sigma)\), which is the same
Prop. 1.3.16.
