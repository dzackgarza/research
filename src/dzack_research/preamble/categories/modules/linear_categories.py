    r"""The category of \(R\)-linear categories and \(R\)-linear functors.

    An \(R\)-linear category is a category \(\mathcal{C}\) with an
    \(R\)-module structure on every \(\operatorname{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(X, Y)\)
    for which composition is \(R\)-bilinear.  Mathlib states it as
    ``CategoryTheory.Linear R C`` over ``Preadditive C``
    (``Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Linear/Basic.lean``).  Over \(\mathbb{Z}\) the
    linear structure is the enrichment in abelian groups, so
    ``LinearCategories(ZZ)`` is the category of preadditive categories of
    ``lean-categories`` FOUNDATIONS Definition 14.1.

    Forgetting the linear structure in place leaves a category, which is the
    declaration.  The preadditive category underlying an \(R\)-linear category
    is its restriction of scalars along \(\mathbb{Z} \to R\), a change of base
    and so a functor, never a supercategory (``CAT-16``).

class TriangulatedCategories(OwnedCategoryOverBaseRing):
    r"""The category of \(R\)-linear triangulated categories and exact functors.

    A triangulated category is a triple \((\mathcal{D}, [1], T)\) with
    \(\mathcal{D}\) an additive category, \([1] : \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D}\)
    an additive auto-equivalence, and \(T\) a class of triangles
    \(X \to Y \to Z \to X[1]\), the distinguished triangles, subject to
    TR1--TR4 (Stacks Project, Tag 0145, Definition 13.3.2).  It is
    \(R\)-linear when \(\mathcal{D}\) is \(R\)-linear and \([1]\) is
    \(R\)-linear.  Mathlib states the structure as ``Pretriangulated C`` with
    ``IsTriangulated C`` (``Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Triangulated/``), together
    with ``Linear R C``.  The derived category \(D(R)\) of
    \(R\)-modules is one (Stacks Project, Tag 05QI, Chapter 13).

    The shift and the distinguished triangles are chosen structure on an
    additive \(R\)-linear category; forgetting them in place leaves the
    additive \(R\)-linear category, which is the declaration.  The
    1-morphisms are the exact functors: \(R\)-linear functors commuting with
    the shift and carrying distinguished triangles to distinguished
    triangles (Mathlib ``Functor.IsTriangulated``).  ``lean-categories``
    FOUNDATIONS Remark 65.2 states that for categories of triangulated categories this
    class of 1-morphisms is part of the definition.
