r"""Tor and Ext of finitely presented modules, computed from a free resolution.

For a module ``M`` with free resolution ``F_• -> M`` and a second module
``N``, the derived functors of ``- ⊗ N`` and ``Hom(-, N)`` are

``Tor_n(M, N) = H_n(F_• ⊗ N)``  and  ``Ext^n(M, N) = H^n(Hom(F_•, N))``.

Both are read off cohomology modules of represented cochain complexes, so a
result remembers the complex it was computed in and its cycle
representatives.  ``F_• ⊗ N`` is a chain complex; it is stored as a cochain
complex with ``F_i ⊗ N`` in degree ``shift - i``, and ``Tor_n`` is its
cohomology in degree ``shift - n``.

Both read the resolution one term past the degree asked for, because homology
in degree ``n`` needs the map into ``F_n`` as well as the map out of it.  Over
a principal ideal domain the resolution stops in degree one however far it is
asked to go; over a polynomial ring it continues by syzygies.
