r"""Abelianization as the left adjoint to the inclusion of abelian groups.

For the owned group categories,

``(-)^ab ⊣ i : Ab -> Grp``.

The implementation uses GAP's natural quotient by the derived subgroup.  The
quotient map itself is retained as the unit, and morphisms are transported by
the universal property of that quotient rather than by a presentation chosen
in Python.
