    The target's constructor admits the image arrow and gives its selected
    representation: an element of an enriched Mor, or a constructed object
    of an unenriched fixed category.  Raw-arrow membership is not object
    placement in the latter.  The common functor action owns admission and
    caches both objects and 2-arrows, as for End and Aut below.

    For a discrete source Mor the arrow action is forced. Otherwise the
    construction requires ``on_two_morphism``, except for the canonical lift
    of the identity functor. The supplied action must preserve identity and
    vertical composition. It is local to this fixed Mor: an ordinary functor
    does not determine an action on natural transformations, and a local lift
    does not assert the horizontal coherence of a 2-functor. Compare Mathlib,
    ``CategoryTheory.PrelaxFunctor.map₂`` / ``map₂_id`` / ``map₂_comp`` in
    ``Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Bicategory/Functor/Prelax.lean``.
