r"""Orbifolds: spaces locally modelled on quotients of ``R^n`` by finite groups.

An ``n``-dimensional (smooth) orbifold is a paracompact Hausdorff space
``X`` with an orbifold atlas: an open cover by charts ``(U~, G, phi)``,
where ``U~`` is a connected open subset of ``R^n``, ``G`` a finite group of
diffeomorphisms of ``U~``, and ``phi: U~ -> X`` a ``G``-invariant map
inducing a homeomorphism of ``G\U~`` onto an open subset of ``X``, with
smooth embeddings of charts over inclusions of their images (Satake, "On a
generalization of the notion of manifold", 1956; Thurston, *The Geometry
and Topology of Three-Manifolds*, Ch. 13; Adem--Leida--Ruan, *Orbifolds and
Stringy Topology*, Ch. 1).  A smooth manifold is an orbifold whose charts
all have trivial group.  For a discrete group ``Gamma`` acting properly
discontinuously on a manifold ``M``, the orbit space ``Gamma\M`` is an
orbifold (Thurston, Ch. 13).
