r"""Complex analytic spaces (Grauert--Remmert, *Coherent Analytic Sheaves*, Ch. 1).

A complex analytic space is a locally ``C``-ringed Hausdorff space
``(X, O_X)`` locally isomorphic to a local model: for a domain ``U`` in
``C^n`` and holomorphic ``f_1, ..., f_k`` on ``U``, the zero set
``N = V(f_1, ..., f_k)`` with the sheaf ``(O_U/(f_1, ..., f_k))|_N``.  A
complex manifold is a complex analytic space whose local models are domains
in ``C^n``; such a space is reduced and normal.
