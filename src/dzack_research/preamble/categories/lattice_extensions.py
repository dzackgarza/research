r"""Primitive extensions of two orthogonal integral lattices.

The finite gluing step is the one used by OSCAR's primitive-embedding
algorithms (``QuadFormAndIsom/embeddings.jl`` at ``d135b70b``,
``_overlattice_with_graph`` and ``_primitive_extensions_generic``).
For even lattices ``M`` and ``N``, an even overlattice of ``M + N`` is
specified by an isotropic subgroup of ``A_M + A_N``.  Both summands remain
primitive exactly when that subgroup meets each discriminant summand
trivially, equivalently when it is the graph of an anti-isometry between
subgroups of their discriminant forms.

The routines here retain the two actual embeddings into each extension.
They enumerate the full finite gluing family; callers that classify up to
additional isometries can quotient that family by their stated actions.

    Each pair is ``(left -> V, right -> V)`` with one common codomain,
    orthogonal images, and torsion-free cokernels.  Every even primitive
    extension occurs.  Distinct pairs can have isometric codomains or
    become equivalent under isometries of the summands; no such quotient
    is imposed here.

    The inputs must be nondegenerate even lattices of finite rank over
    ``ZZ``.  If ``unimodular`` is true, only glue groups ``H`` satisfying
    ``|H|^2 = |A_(left + right)|`` are retained.  This is precisely the
    determinant-one condition for the corresponding overlattice.

    Filtering by primitivity of both retained embeddings is the graph
    condition: a nonzero intersection of ``H`` with ``A_left`` enlarges
    ``left`` inside its rational span, and likewise for ``right``.  Thus
    this filter retains exactly the anti-isometry gluings used by the
    pinned primitive-extension routine.
