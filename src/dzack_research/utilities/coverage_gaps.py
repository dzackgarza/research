r"""Report the preamble lines and branches that no passing test runs.

``just coverage`` records coverage per test: pytest-cov's ``--cov-context=test``
labels every measured line with the node id of the test that ran it
(https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contexts.html), and the run's
pytest report log records each test's outcome.  This report counts a line as
covered only when a passing test ran it, or when it ran at import, outside any
test.  A line that only failing or erroring tests reach is reported missing:
executing it proved nothing.

The report is coverage.py's own, restricted by ``Coverage.report(contexts=...)``
(https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contexts.html#context-reporting).

Every report log in the coverage directory is read oldest first, so a test
rerun by ``just coverage-add`` or ``just coverage-update`` supersedes its
outcome in the full run.  A source file changed since the last measurement is
listed as stale: its recorded line numbers no longer describe the file.
``--select-affected`` purges the stale files and names the tests to rerun: the
ones recorded as running a line of them, and every edited test file.  So after
one full run, a check costs the tests the edits reach, not the suite.  A test
that reaches an edited file only through a call the edit introduced is not
selected; the next full run measures it.

Run ``python -m dzack_research.utilities.coverage_gaps [--include GLOB ...]
[--touched-by DATAFILE] [--select-affected]``, or the ``just coverage-*``
recipes.
