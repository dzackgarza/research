# Open items

Things noticed while moving the dissertation from LaTeX back to Markdown that need the author's judgment.
None of them blocks the build, which compiles with no LaTeX errors.

## Possibly missing content

- `sections/1-part-combinatorial/3-chapter-enriques-k3/450-scattone.md` carries
  the Scattone boundary analysis only for $F_2$, where it lists the four
  lattices of the genus $G(1)$ containing $A_{17}$. Working notes in the old
  dissertation tree also carried the parallel analysis for $F_4$, where
  $N \cong D_7$: the seven Niemeier lattices containing $D_7$

  $$\tilde E_8^{3},\ \tilde E_8 \oplus \tilde D_{16},\ \tilde E_7^{2} \oplus \tilde D_{10},\ \tilde D_{12}^{2},\ \tilde D_8^{3},\ \tilde D_9 \oplus \tilde A_{15},\ \tilde E_6 \oplus \tilde D_7 \oplus \tilde A_{11}$$

  and their orthogonal complements, giving nine possibilities, among them
  $\tilde D_{17}$, $\tilde D_{12} \oplus \tilde D_5$,
  $\langle -4 \rangle \oplus \tilde D_8^{2}$,
  $\tilde A_1^{2} \oplus \tilde A_{15}$, and $\tilde E_6 \oplus \tilde A_{11}$.
  The note observes that these can be recovered by running Vinberg's algorithm
  on $\langle -4 \rangle \oplus U \oplus E_8^{2}$, and that the resulting
  Coxeter diagram matches Scattone 1987, Figure 6.3.1, while differing from the
  one for $(18,2,0)$ in AET. Whether the thesis wants the degree 4 case is a
  completeness decision, not a loss: the content is in Scattone.

## Structure

- Part II carries only its part heading; Parts I and III each open with framing prose.
  The submitted LaTeX had four subsection headings here that the Markdown never had, so this is a long-standing divergence, not a regression.

## Notes on the move

- Citation keys were remapped to the live Zotero library, so a key in the text now matches the Better BibTeX key of the item.
  Two of them changed meaning: Zotero has `Sha81` for Shah's degree 4 K3 paper and `Sha81a` for his Enriques paper, which is the opposite of the old local bibliography, and the text was swapped to match Zotero.
  Worth spot-checking the two citation sites.

- `[@Alexeev]` appears twice inside HTML comments in `sections/2-part-moduli/4-chapter-cpt/000-ksba.md`. It resolves to nothing, but the comments are invisible to the build, so nothing is broken.
