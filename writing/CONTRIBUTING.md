# Contributing to the book

This is a mathematical book. Contributions are definitions, theorems,
constructions, examples, and remarks in standard mathematical register.
Each entry below has a code, a banned example, and the replacement.

## Prose (`PR-*`)

Bad prose on its own terms. The fix is a rewrite.

### `PR-1`: Self-narration

The prose describes what the document is or does instead of doing it.

**Banned:** "This is the framework that situates the conversion; it is
mathematics, not procedure."

**Preferred:** "The specified forgetful functor, its pullbacks, and the
intersections of replete full subcategories used in the Sage-to-Lean
conversion." State the content; do not characterize the text.

### `PR-2`: Reflexive negative parallelism

A notion is characterized by contrast with the alternative it rejects.

**Banned:** "$a = b$ is a theorem, never a definitional identity."

**Preferred:** state the positive claim and stop. If the contrast carries
information, make it a Remark and explain it in context.

### `PR-3`: Self-certification

The text asserts it satisfies a property — dependency order, completeness,
minimality, "the single source", "canonical", "self-contained" — which no
sentence can make true.

**Banned:** "The definitions and results, in dependency order."

**Preferred:** delete the assertion. If the property is required, record it
where an auditor checks it against the artifact.

### `PR-4`: Theory of mind

The prose tells the reader what the mathematics implies or how to read it.

**Banned:** "equality, isomorphism, and equivalence are distinguished and
named wherever the distinction is content."

**Preferred:** delete. Distinct definitions are already distinct.

### `PR-5`: Puffery and AI-vocabulary

Words that rate the mathematics or belong to the generic LLM register.

**Banned:** "crucial", "pivotal", "powerful", "elegant", "deep", "rich",
"intricate", "interplay", "robust", "seamless", "leverage", "delve",
"underscore", "showcase", "boasts", "foster", "meticulous", "tapestry",
"testament", "landscape", "realm", and the connectives "it is worth noting",
"importantly", "note that", "of course", "clearly" (where it is not).

**Preferred:** delete the word; state the content plainly.

### `PR-6`: Cadence padding

Structure produced for rhythm.

**Banned:** the reflexive rule of three, "not only … but also", formulaic
transitions opening successive sentences ("Additionally", "Moreover",
"Furthermore", "Notably"), conclusion-restatement ("in summary", "as we have
seen"), em-dash or parenthetical density.

**Preferred:** keep what is needed; cut what is there for cadence.

### `PR-7`: Concept defined by notational payoff

A theorem or property is characterized by its effect on notation rather than
by its mathematical content, using a conversational construction ("is what
licenses", "is what allows", "is what lets us") instead of stating the
theorem and deriving the convention from it.

**Banned:** "Coherence is what licenses the notation
$a_1\otimes\cdots\otimes a_n$ without parentheses."

**Preferred:** "By the coherence theorem, $a_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes a_n$ is
well-defined up to the canonical associator, so parentheses are omitted."
State the theorem, then let the notational convention follow as a
consequence. A standard text may explain that a theorem permits a
notational shorthand; it does not define the theorem as that shorthand's
justification.

### `PR-8`: Superficial "-ing" analysis

A trailing participial clause performs analysis without adding content.

**Banned:** "the pullback is universal, underscoring the classifier's role."

**Preferred:** delete the clause, or replace it with the statement it gestures
at — a theorem, a cross-reference, an actual consequence.

### `PR-9`: Undue emphasis

`**bold**` used for emphasis or to mark a defined term in running prose.

**Preferred:** *italic* for a term at its definition; **bold** only as a
run-in label at the start of a list item or paragraph ("**In
$\mathbf{Set}$.**", "**Remark.**"). Never bold to weight a clause.

### `PR-10`: Formatting tells

**Banned:** Title Case in headings; curly quotes; emoji; collaborative or
meta language ("let me know", "I hope this helps"); bold-header bullet lists
where prose is clearer.

**Preferred:** sentence case in headings; straight quotes; no emoji; no
collaborative or meta language.

### `PR-11`: Project process inside mathematical exposition

A mathematical chapter pauses to discuss rulings, audit procedure,
implementation status, or editorial policy.

**Banned:** "This ruling guards the conversion pipeline and is enforced by
the audit."

**Preferred:** state the mathematical proposition. Project process belongs in
agent-facing files, not in a mathematical chapter.

## Evasion (`EV-*`)

Prose that substitutes for mathematical work not done. The tell is stylistic;
the defect is that a definition was not written or an object not named. The
remediation is never a nicer phrase — it is the work.

### `EV-1`: Vibe-adjectives for a definition

Impressive qualifiers replace the definition itself.

**Banned:** "The subcategory is structurally complete under sameness."

**Preferred:** write the definition — "A full subcategory
$\mathcal D \subseteq \mathcal C$ is *replete* if every object of
$\mathcal C$ isomorphic to an object of $\mathcal D$ belongs to
$\mathcal D$." "Structurally complete under sameness" is a mood; the
definition is the work.

### `EV-2`: Carrier / "carries"

"carries" and "carrier" suppress the data that constitute a structure.

**Banned:** "objects that carry both structures"; "an object together with a
carried structure"; "the underlying set carries the operation."

**Preferred:** name the operations, relations, and axioms, or specify the
forgetful functor and the chosen object in its fiber. A structure on $X$ is a
chosen object in the fiber over $X$ of a specified forgetful functor
$U\colon \mathcal S\to\mathcal C$; the underlying set is the value $U(X)$.

### `EV-3`: Engineering collective nouns

"package", "frame", "pipeline", "suite", "layer", and a vague "slice" gather
mathematical objects under a process or software noun instead of naming them.

**Banned:** "the discriminant package"; "the forms frame"; "the equality
slice".

**Preferred:** "the discriminant construction and its exact sequences"; "the
categories $\mathcal B_{R,W}$ and $\mathcal Q_{R,W}$"; the exact chapter,
section, or mathematical construction meant.

### `EV-4`: Vague hedges for precision

**Banned:** "essentially", "basically", "morally", "roughly", "in some sense"
used where an exact statement is owed.

**Preferred:** state it exactly, or, if a genuine approximation is meant,
name the sense ("up to isomorphism", "to first order").

### `EV-5`: Universal construction left in prose

A construction defined by a pullback, pushout, or another universal square is
abbreviated as "obtained by pulling back" or an equivalent prose instruction.

**Banned:** "Define $E\to X$ by pulling back $p\colon U\to B$ along
$f\colon X\to B$."

**Preferred:** draw the actual commutative square, label every morphism, mark
it cartesian or cocartesian, and name the resulting object and structure
morphism in the diagram. The prose may state the universal property after
the diagram; it never replaces the diagram.

## Mathematical tells (`MA-*`)

Colloquial or reinvented parlance in place of the standard notion, or of the
definition the book already fixes. The remediation is the established
definition — cite it.

### `MA-1`: Prior substitution for the book's definition

An agent writes the definition it recalls from training or an external source
without reading the book's defining occurrence.

**Banned:** writing $a=b$ after the book has constructed only an isomorphism
$a\cong b$; calling a map a "classifier" without the universal property
required at its defining occurrence.

**Preferred:** read and cite the book's anchor. If that definition conflicts
with the literature, correct it at the defining occurrence and repair its
dependents; do not shadow it locally.

### `MA-2`: Coinage for a standard notion

A private word stands in for a notion with a standard name.

**Banned:** "cut" / "axiom cut" (→ full subcategory defined by a property, or
specified forgetful functor); "refinement" for a subcategory (→ full
subcategory); "least common category" (→ a greatest lower bound in the
specified preorder of categories, if it exists).

**Preferred:** the standard term or the book's term.

### `MA-3`: Notation colliding with a standard meaning

A symbol is reused against its near-universal reading.

**Banned:** "$\mathbf{Sh}_\Sigma$" for a diagram/functor category ("$\mathbf{Sh}$"
is sheaves).

**Preferred:** a non-colliding symbol ("$\mathbf{Dia}_\Sigma$"), or the plain
construction ($\operatorname{Fun}(\Sigma, \mathcal C)$).

### `MA-4`: Elegant variation

The same object is renamed sentence to sentence to avoid repetition, so one
notion acquires several names.

**Preferred:** repeat the exact term. Notation retains its typed meaning
throughout the book.

### `MA-5`: Borrowed technical term without a definition

A word that carries a specific technical meaning (character, spectrum, kernel,
index, module) is used loosely and left undefined.

**Banned:** "the character of an axiom" (read as a group/representation
character; no such notion is defined).

**Preferred:** state the truncation level of the homotopy fibers of the
specified functor, or name the defined object property actually meant.

### `MA-6`: Cardinality label for an incidental count

Naming a structure by how many things it has — "trichotomy", "dichotomy", "the
three-fold", "$N$-fold" — asserts the count is mathematically load-bearing.

**Banned:** "the stuff / structure / property trichotomy" — nothing turns on
"three"; the classification is by fullness and faithfulness and, in higher
categories, by the truncation level of the homotopy fibers.

**Preferred:** name the classification by content, not by tally.

### `MA-7`: Backwards or premature notation

A symbol is introduced with `:=` pointing from the standard, primitive
notation to the coinage, or coined notation is used before it is defined.

**Banned:** "$E_A := B_A.A$" before either notation has a defining occurrence.

**Preferred:** first specify the family $p_A\colon E_A\to B_A$ and the map
$\chi\colon\mathcal C\to B_A$, then draw their pullback. Only afterward
introduce the shorthand.

### `MA-8`: Compressed notation where the diagram is owed

A pullback written as the apex $A \times_C B$, or a universal family named only
by its classifying map $S \to M$, in place of the cartesian square that
records the projections and the universal property.

**Banned:** "the family is the base change $S \times_M U$"; "$S \to M$
classifies the family" as the whole of it.

**Preferred:** draw the square (`tikzcd`) with both legs and the corner mark,
and use fiber-product notation only as a named shorthand for the apex once its
square is drawn.

### `MA-9`: Colloquial "ownership" for a mathematical relation

"owns", "owned at", and "ownership" replace the relation that should be
stated.

**Banned:** "commutativity is owned at $\mathbf{Mag}$"; "the node that owns
the property"; "the object owns its local invariants".

**Preferred:** name the relation — "commutativity is a property of magmas",
"the category whose objects satisfy the property", "the invariants are
defined on the object".

### `MA-10`: Classifier language without a universal property

"classifier", "classifying category", and "universal family" are used as
labels before a representing or universal property is stated.

**Banned:** "$u_A\colon E_A\to B_A$ is the axiom classifier" with no
description of the objects it classifies or the equivalence it represents.

**Preferred:** state the property or structure directly. If a classifying
object or fibration exists, state its universal property and call a change
along a functor the pullback family.

### `MA-11`: An arrow without a typed map

A diagram connects mathematical nouns because they are related in the author's
head, without naming a functor, natural transformation, or map having the
displayed source and target.

**Banned:** an object-to-category edge for membership; a discriminant arrow
from the full lattice category when the construction is functorial only on its
core; an unlabeled edge whose direction could mean either inclusion or
forgetting structure.

**Preferred:** write the actual source, target, and arrow label. Replace
membership by prose, restrict a construction to its stated domain, and display
a set-valued invariant as a map from $\pi_0$.

## Definitions (`DEF-*`)

### `DEF-1`: One defining occurrence

Each mathematical notion has one defining occurrence in the book. Later
chapters cite it. They do not restate it, shadow it with a synonym, or write a
second local definition.

### `DEF-2`: Read the book before writing a dependent passage

Read the book's defining occurrence and its prerequisites before writing a
dependent passage. A definition reconstructed from training or an external
source is inadmissible even when it resembles a standard definition.

### `DEF-3`: Correct at the defining occurrence

If the book's definition conflicts with the literature, correct it at the
defining occurrence and repair its dependents. Do not shadow it locally.

### `DEF-4`: Numbered block syntax

```markdown
::: {#def-universe}
## Universe and decoded objects

Work in an external cartesian closed $(\infty,\infty)$-category $\mathcal K$
with pullbacks and terminal object $*$.
:::
```

The declared block classes are listed at the bottom of
`writing/.book/_quarto.yml`. Add a class there before using it.

## Cross-references (`XREF-*`)

### `XREF-1`: `\ref` and `\longref` only

`\ref` and `\longref` are the only two commands that resolve numbered blocks.
They reach any numbered block in the book, in any chapter, in either
direction.

### `XREF-2`: No `\cref` or `\Cref`

**Banned:** `\cref`, `\Cref`. They do not match the resolver. Pandoc drops an
unmatched macro silently, so the reference disappears and the sentence around
it is left dangling.

### `XREF-3`: Label format

Labels use colon separators: `def:universe`, `thm:coble-cusps`. Do not start a
label with a Quarto-reserved prefix (`def-`, `thm-`, `lem-`, `cor-`, `prp-`,
`cnj-`, `exm-`, `exr-`, `fig-`, `tbl-`, `eq-`, `sec-`, `lst-`); use a hyphen
instead. Quarto hijacks those prefixes for its own crossrefs and the render
fails.

### `XREF-4`: Sections and figures

Sections auto-number. Reference a section by link:
`[Lattice Theory](lattice-theory.md#sec:lattice-theory)`.

Figures use Quarto's own numbering. Anchor a figure `{#fig-x}`, with a hyphen,
and reference it `@fig-x`.

## Citations (`CITE-*`)

### `CITE-1`: Better BibTeX keys

Use Better BibTeX keys: `[@OR23, Definition 1.5.1]`. Zotero is the source of
truth. If a work is not in Zotero, add it there first.

### `CITE-2`: No inline URLs

**Banned:** an inline URL to arXiv, a DOI, or nLab. The docs gate rejects it.

## Diagrams (`DIA-*`)

### `DIA-1`: Draw the square

Draw a universal construction as its square. Label every morphism. Mark it
cartesian or cocartesian. Name the resulting object and structure morphism in
the diagram. The prose may state the universal property after the diagram; it
never replaces the diagram.

### `DIA-2`: Every arrow is typed

Every arrow in a diagram names a functor, natural transformation, or map with
the displayed source and target. A construction defined only on cores is drawn
from the cores. An invariant on isomorphism classes is drawn as a map from
$\pi_0$. Membership of an object in a category is not drawn as a functor
between categories.

## Notation (`NOT-*`)

### `NOT-1`: State the mathematical type

State the mathematical type of every named entity. Distinguish objects and
morphisms in a specified category, categories and functors, natural
transformations, object properties, chosen structures, invariants, sections,
and obstructions.

### `NOT-2`: Typed equality symbols

Literal equality ($=$), isomorphism ($\cong$), and equivalence ($\simeq$) are
written with distinct symbols. $\hookrightarrow$ denotes a stated inclusion,
embedding, or monomorphism; fullness, faithfulness, and repleteness are
asserted separately.

### `NOT-3`: One symbol, one meaning

The same symbol has the same type and meaning throughout the book. Project
notation is introduced at the defining occurrence, after the underlying
standard construction has been stated.

### `NOT-4`: Standard names

Use established names in their standard meanings: category of elements,
Grothendieck construction, core, arrow category, full subcategory, replete,
natural isomorphism, automorphism group, torsor, monoidal category, abelian
category, kernel, cokernel, discriminant form, genus, isometry, classifying
object. Do not coin a name for a notion that already has one.

## Properties and structure (`STR-*`)

### `STR-1`: Use the forgetful functor

For a specified forgetful functor $U\colon\mathcal S\to\mathcal C$, full
faithfulness gives at most property, faithfulness gives at most structure, and
an arbitrary functor gives at most stuff. Repleteness is a separate condition
when an essential image is replaced by a full subcategory.

### `STR-2`: Name every chosen structure

A structure on $X$ is a chosen object in the fiber over $X$ of a specified
forgetful functor. When several choices exist, name the one used by the
construction. For example, tensor product and direct sum give different
monoidal structures on modules.

### `STR-3`: State every hypothesis

A theorem states every object property, characteristic restriction, limit
assumption, flatness assumption, and equality of named morphisms used in its
conclusion. If a construction uses a basis, embedding, section, presentation,
or other witness, name that witness in the construction.
