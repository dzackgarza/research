# Contributing to the book

This is a mathematical book. Contributions are definitions, theorems,
constructions, examples, and remarks in standard mathematical register.
Each entry below has a code, a banned example, and the replacement.

## Prose (`PR-*`)

Bad prose on its own terms. The fix is a rewrite.

### `PR-1`: Self-narration

The prose describes what the document is or does instead of doing it.

**Banned:** "This is the framework that situates the conversion; it is
mathematics, not procedure."

**Preferred:** "The specified forgetful functor, its pullbacks, and the
intersections of replete full subcategories used in the Sage-to-Lean
conversion." State the content; do not characterize the text.

### `PR-2`: Reflexive negative parallelism

A notion is characterized by contrast with the alternative it rejects.

**Banned:** "$a = b$ is a theorem, never a definitional identity."

**Preferred:** state the positive claim and stop. If the contrast carries
information, make it a Remark and explain it in context.

### `PR-3`: Self-certification

The text asserts it satisfies a property — dependency order, completeness,
minimality, "the single source", "canonical", "self-contained" — which no
sentence can make true.

**Banned:** "The definitions and results, in dependency order."

**Preferred:** delete the assertion. If the property is required, record it
where an auditor checks it against the artifact.

### `PR-4`: Theory of mind

The prose tells the reader what the mathematics implies or how to read it.

**Banned:** "equality, isomorphism, and equivalence are distinguished and
named wherever the distinction is content."

**Preferred:** delete. Distinct definitions are already distinct.

### `PR-5`: Puffery and AI-vocabulary

Words that rate the mathematics or belong to the generic LLM register.

**Banned:** "crucial", "pivotal", "powerful", "elegant", "deep", "rich",
"intricate", "interplay", "robust", "seamless", "leverage", "delve",
"underscore", "showcase", "boasts", "foster", "meticulous", "tapestry",
"testament", "landscape", "realm", and the connectives "it is worth noting",
"importantly", "note that", "of course", "clearly" (where it is not).

**Preferred:** delete the word; state the content plainly.

### `PR-6`: Cadence padding

Structure produced for rhythm.

**Banned:** the reflexive rule of three, "not only … but also", formulaic
transitions opening successive sentences ("Additionally", "Moreover",
"Furthermore", "Notably"), conclusion-restatement ("in summary", "as we have
seen"), em-dash or parenthetical density.

**Preferred:** keep what is needed; cut what is there for cadence.

### `PR-7`: Concept defined by notational payoff

A theorem or property is characterized by its effect on notation rather than
by its mathematical content, using a conversational construction ("is what
licenses", "is what allows", "is what lets us") instead of stating the
theorem and deriving the convention from it.

**Banned:** "Coherence is what licenses the notation
$a_1\otimes\cdots\otimes a_n$ without parentheses."

**Preferred:** "By the coherence theorem, any two parenthesizations of
$a_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes a_n$ are connected by a unique composite of
associators, so the expression is independent of parenthesization;
parentheses are omitted." State the theorem — what is well-defined, and in
what sense — then let the notational convention follow as a consequence.
A standard text may explain that a theorem permits a notational shorthand;
it does not define the theorem as that shorthand's justification.

### `PR-8`: Superficial "-ing" analysis

A trailing participial clause performs analysis without adding content.

**Banned:** "the pullback is universal, underscoring the classifier's role."

**Preferred:** delete the clause, or replace it with the statement it gestures
at — a theorem, a cross-reference, an actual consequence.

### `PR-9`: Construction and verification in one sentence

A single sentence simultaneously constructs an object and verifies its
required properties, hiding the logical structure the reader needs to follow.

**Banned:** "A category with finite products is monoidal with
$a\otimes b$ a chosen product $a\times b$ and $e$ a terminal object, the
three isomorphisms being the unique ones commuting with the projections; this
is the cartesian monoidal structure."

**Preferred:** separate the construction from the verification. "The product
functor $\times\colon\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}$, together
with a terminal object $\mathbf{1}$ as unit, defines a monoidal structure
on $\mathcal{C}$. The associator $\alpha_{a,b,c}$ and the unitors
$\lambda_a$, $\varrho_a$ are the unique isomorphisms supplied by the
universal property of the product." State the functor, then verify the
axioms. A reader follows construction, then verification; a semicolon-joined
sentence conflates them.

### `PR-10`: Undue emphasis

`**bold**` used for emphasis or to mark a defined term in running prose.

**Preferred:** *italic* for a term at its definition; **bold** only as a
run-in label at the start of a list item or paragraph ("**In
$\mathbf{Set}$.**", "**Remark.**"). Never bold to weight a clause.

### `PR-11`: Formatting tells

**Banned:** Title Case in headings; curly quotes; emoji; collaborative or
meta language ("let me know", "I hope this helps"); bold-header bullet lists
where prose is clearer.

**Preferred:** sentence case in headings; straight quotes; no emoji; no
collaborative or meta language.

### `PR-12`: Project process inside mathematical exposition

A mathematical chapter pauses to discuss rulings, audit procedure,
implementation status, or editorial policy.

**Banned:** "This ruling guards the conversion pipeline and is enforced by
the audit."

**Preferred:** state the mathematical proposition. Project process belongs in
agent-facing files, not in a mathematical chapter.

## Evasion (`EV-*`)

Prose that substitutes for mathematical work not done. The tell is stylistic;
the defect is that a definition was not written or an object not named. The
remediation is never a nicer phrase — it is the work.

### `EV-1`: Vibe-adjectives for a definition

Impressive qualifiers replace the definition itself.

**Banned:** "The subcategory is structurally complete under sameness."

**Preferred:** write the definition — "A full subcategory
$\mathcal D \subseteq \mathcal C$ is *replete* if every object of
$\mathcal C$ isomorphic to an object of $\mathcal D$ belongs to
$\mathcal D$." "Structurally complete under sameness" is a mood; the
definition is the work.

### `EV-2`: Carrier / "carries"

"carries" and "carrier" suppress the data that constitute a structure.

**Banned:** "objects that carry both structures"; "an object together with a
carried structure"; "the underlying set carries the operation."

**Preferred:** name the operations, relations, and axioms, or specify the
forgetful functor and the chosen object in its fiber. A structure on $X$ is a
chosen object in the fiber over $X$ of a specified forgetful functor
$U\colon \mathcal S\to\mathcal C$; the underlying set is the value $U(X)$.

### `EV-3`: Engineering collective nouns

"package", "frame", "pipeline", "suite", "layer", and a vague "slice" gather
mathematical objects under a process or software noun instead of naming them.

**Banned:** "the discriminant package"; "the forms frame"; "the equality
slice".

**Preferred:** "the discriminant construction and its exact sequences"; "the
categories $\mathcal B_{R,W}$ and $\mathcal Q_{R,W}$"; the exact chapter,
section, or mathematical construction meant.

### `EV-4`: Vague hedges for precision

**Banned:** "essentially", "basically", "morally", "roughly", "in some sense"
used where an exact statement is owed.

**Preferred:** state it exactly, or, if a genuine approximation is meant,
name the sense ("up to isomorphism", "to first order").

### `EV-5`: Universal construction left in prose

A construction defined by a pullback, pushout, or another universal square is
abbreviated as "obtained by pulling back" or an equivalent prose instruction.

**Banned:** "Define $E\to X$ by pulling back $p\colon U\to B$ along
$f\colon X\to B$."

**Preferred:** draw the actual commutative square, label every morphism, mark
it cartesian or cocartesian, and name the resulting object and structure
morphism in the diagram. The prose may state the universal property after
the diagram; it never replaces the diagram.

### `EV-6`: "Data" for a mathematical object

A construction operates on objects, morphisms, 2-cells, or elements of a
specified category. "Data" names none of them; it is a programmer's
abstraction standing where a mathematical object belongs.

**Banned:** "a construction that transports data along $\alpha$, $\lambda$,
or $\varrho$."

**Preferred:** name the things the construction operates on — "a construction
that composes a cell with $\alpha$, $\lambda$, or $\varrho$." The word "data"
erases the type; the replacement names it.

### `EV-7`: Metaphor for an unnamed operation

A sentence says something "transports", "carries", "flows", or "moves" along
a map or cell without naming the categorical operation — composition,
whiskering, application, base change, conjugation — that performs it.

**Banned:** "transports data along $\alpha$."

**Preferred:** name the operation — "composes with $\alpha$", "applies
$\alpha$ to the cell", "whiskers $\alpha$ against $F$." The metaphor hides
which operation; the replacement states it.

### `EV-8`: Universal property invoked but not stated

A sentence appeals to "the projections", "the universal property", or "the
unique map" without stating which universal property, from which object, to
which target. The uniqueness is real, but the reader cannot verify it
without the property identified.

**Banned:** "the three isomorphisms being the unique ones commuting with the
projections."

**Preferred:** "the associator $\alpha_{a,b,c}$ and the unitors
$\lambda_a$, $\varrho_a$ are the unique isomorphisms supplied by the
universal property of the product." Name the universal property and the
object that supplies it.

## Mathematical tells (`MA-*`)

Colloquial or reinvented parlance in place of the standard notion, or of the
definition the book already fixes. The remediation is the established
definition — cite it.

### `MA-1`: Prior substitution for the book's definition

An agent writes the definition it recalls from training or an external source
without reading the book's defining occurrence.

**Banned:** writing $a=b$ after the book has constructed only an isomorphism
$a\cong b$; calling a map a "classifier" without the universal property
required at its defining occurrence.

**Preferred:** read and cite the book's anchor. If that definition conflicts
with the literature, correct it at the defining occurrence and repair its
dependents; do not shadow it locally.

### `MA-2`: Coinage for a standard notion

A private word stands in for a notion with a standard name.

**Banned:** "cut" / "axiom cut" (→ full subcategory defined by a property, or
specified forgetful functor); "refinement" for a subcategory (→ full
subcategory); "least common category" (→ a greatest lower bound in the
specified preorder of categories, if it exists).

**Preferred:** the standard term or the book's term.

### `MA-3`: Notation colliding with a standard meaning

A symbol is reused against its near-universal reading.

**Banned:** "$\mathbf{Sh}_\Sigma$" for a diagram/functor category ("$\mathbf{Sh}$"
is sheaves).

**Preferred:** a non-colliding symbol ("$\mathbf{Dia}_\Sigma$"), or the plain
construction ($\operatorname{Fun}(\Sigma, \mathcal C)$).

### `MA-4`: Elegant variation

The same object is renamed sentence to sentence to avoid repetition, so one
notion acquires several names.

**Preferred:** repeat the exact term. Notation retains its typed meaning
throughout the book.

### `MA-5`: Borrowed technical term without a definition

A word that carries a specific technical meaning (character, spectrum, kernel,
index, module, classified by) is used loosely to describe something that has
a different, standard name. A mathematician reads it as the technical term
and finds no matching definition — the word signals precision and delivers
none.

**Banned:** "the character of an axiom" (read as a group/representation
character; no such notion is defined); "the bilinear map classified by
$\mu$" (classified by means a classifying object represents a functor;
the correspondence is the tensor-hom adjunction).

**Preferred:** state the actual correspondence or property. "The bilinear
map $A\times A\to A$ corresponding to $\mu$ under the tensor-hom
adjunction." Use the standard name for the standard notion.

### `MA-6`: Cardinality label for an incidental count

Naming a structure by how many things it has — "trichotomy", "dichotomy", "the
three-fold", "$N$-fold" — asserts the count is mathematically load-bearing.

**Banned:** "the stuff / structure / property trichotomy" — nothing turns on
"three"; the classification is by fullness and faithfulness and, in higher
categories, by the truncation level of the homotopy fibers.

**Preferred:** name the classification by content, not by tally.

### `MA-7`: Backwards or premature notation

A symbol is introduced with `:=` pointing from the standard, primitive
notation to the coinage, or coined notation is used before it is defined.

**Banned:** "$E_A := B_A.A$" before either notation has a defining occurrence.

**Preferred:** first specify the family $p_A\colon E_A\to B_A$ and the map
$\chi\colon\mathcal C\to B_A$, then draw their pullback. Only afterward
introduce the shorthand.

### `MA-8`: Compressed notation where the diagram is owed

A pullback written as the apex $A \times_C B$, or a universal family named only
by its classifying map $S \to M$, in place of the cartesian square that
records the projections and the universal property.

**Banned:** "the family is the base change $S \times_M U$"; "$S \to M$
classifies the family" as the whole of it.

**Preferred:** draw the square (`tikzcd`) with both legs and the corner mark,
and use fiber-product notation only as a named shorthand for the apex once its
square is drawn.

### `MA-9`: Colloquial "ownership" for a mathematical relation

"owns", "owned at", and "ownership" replace the relation that should be
stated.

**Banned:** "commutativity is owned at $\mathbf{Mag}$"; "the node that owns
the property"; "the object owns its local invariants".

**Preferred:** name the relation — "commutativity is a property of magmas",
"the category whose objects satisfy the property", "the invariants are
defined on the object".

### `MA-10`: Classifier language without a universal property

"classifier", "classifying category", and "universal family" are used as
labels before a representing or universal property is stated.

**Banned:** "$u_A\colon E_A\to B_A$ is the axiom classifier" with no
description of the objects it classifies or the equivalence it represents.

**Preferred:** state the property or structure directly. If a classifying
object or fibration exists, state its universal property and call a change
along a functor the pullback family.

### `MA-11`: An arrow without a typed map

A diagram connects mathematical nouns because they are related in the author's
head, without naming a functor, natural transformation, or map having the
displayed source and target.

**Banned:** an object-to-category edge for membership; a discriminant arrow
from the full lattice category when the construction is functorial only on its
core; an unlabeled edge whose direction could mean either inclusion or
forgetting structure.

**Preferred:** write the actual source, target, and arrow label. Replace
membership by prose, restrict a construction to its stated domain, and display
a set-valued invariant as a map from $\pi_0$.

### `MA-12`: Named maps referred to by count

Standard maps with standard names — the associator $\alpha$, the left unitor
$\lambda$, the right unitor $\varrho$ — are referred to as "the three
isomorphisms" or "the $n$ maps" instead of by name. The reader must infer
which maps from context.

**Banned:** "the three isomorphisms being the unique ones commuting with the
projections."

**Preferred:** "the associator $\alpha_{a,b,c}$ and the unitors
$\lambda_a$, $\varrho_a$." Name the maps. The count carries no mathematical
information.

### `MA-13`: A structure described pointwise instead of as a structure

A functor is a functor: source, target, name. A natural transformation is a
natural transformation: its components and the naturality square. A monoidal
structure is a tuple $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, \mathbf{1}, \alpha, \lambda,
\varrho)$ with axioms. Each of these is a mathematical object with a type and
constituent data. A pointwise description — "a choice of $a \otimes b$ for
every $a$, $b$" — replaces the structure with a recipe for its output on
inputs, the way a programmer describes a function by what it returns. State
the structure; its pointwise behavior may follow.

**Banned:** "choose a product $a \times b$ for each pair of objects and set
$\otimes = \times$."

**Preferred:** "the product functor
$\times\colon\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}$, together with a
terminal object $\mathbf{1}$ and the canonical associator and unitors,
defines a monoidal structure on $\mathcal{C}$."

## Definitions (`DEF-*`)

### `DEF-1`: One defining occurrence

Each mathematical notion has one defining occurrence in the book. Later
chapters cite it. They do not restate it, shadow it with a synonym, or write a
second local definition.

### `DEF-2`: Read the book before writing a dependent passage

Read the book's defining occurrence and its prerequisites before writing a
dependent passage. A definition reconstructed from training or an external
source is inadmissible even when it resembles a standard definition.

### `DEF-3`: Correct at the defining occurrence

If the book's definition conflicts with the literature, correct it at the
defining occurrence and repair its dependents. Do not shadow it locally.

### `DEF-4`: Numbered block syntax

```markdown
::: {#def-universe}
## Universe and decoded objects

Work in an external cartesian closed $(\infty,\infty)$-category $\mathcal K$
with pullbacks and terminal object $*$.
:::
```

The declared block classes are listed at the bottom of
`writing/.book/_quarto.yml`. Add a class there before using it.

## Cross-references (`XREF-*`)

### `XREF-1`: `\ref` and `\longref` only

`\ref` and `\longref` are the only two commands that resolve numbered blocks.
They reach any numbered block in the book, in any chapter, in either
direction.

### `XREF-2`: No `\cref` or `\Cref`

**Banned:** `\cref`, `\Cref`. They do not match the resolver. Pandoc drops an
unmatched macro silently, so the reference disappears and the sentence around
it is left dangling.

### `XREF-3`: Label format

Labels use colon separators: `def:universe`, `thm:coble-cusps`. Do not start a
label with a Quarto-reserved prefix (`def-`, `thm-`, `lem-`, `cor-`, `prp-`,
`cnj-`, `exm-`, `exr-`, `fig-`, `tbl-`, `eq-`, `sec-`, `lst-`); use a hyphen
instead. Quarto hijacks those prefixes for its own crossrefs and the render
fails.

### `XREF-4`: Sections and figures

Sections auto-number. Reference a section by link:
`[Lattice Theory](lattice-theory.md#sec:lattice-theory)`.

Figures use Quarto's own numbering. Anchor a figure `{#fig-x}`, with a hyphen,
and reference it `@fig-x`.

## Citations (`CITE-*`)

### `CITE-1`: Better BibTeX keys

Use Better BibTeX keys: `[@OR23, Definition 1.5.1]`. Zotero is the source of
truth. If a work is not in Zotero, add it there first.

### `CITE-2`: No inline URLs

**Banned:** an inline URL to arXiv, a DOI, or nLab. The docs gate rejects it.

## Diagrams (`DIA-*`)

### `DIA-1`: Draw the square

Draw a universal construction as its square. Label every morphism. Mark it
cartesian or cocartesian. Name the resulting object and structure morphism in
the diagram. The prose may state the universal property after the diagram; it
never replaces the diagram.

### `DIA-2`: Every arrow is typed

Every arrow in a diagram names a functor, natural transformation, or map with
the displayed source and target. A construction defined only on cores is drawn
from the cores. An invariant on isomorphism classes is drawn as a map from
$\pi_0$. Membership of an object in a category is not drawn as a functor
between categories.

## Notation (`NOT-*`)

### `NOT-1`: State the mathematical type

State the mathematical type of every named entity. Distinguish objects and
morphisms in a specified category, categories and functors, natural
transformations, object properties, chosen structures, invariants, sections,
and obstructions.

### `NOT-2`: Typed equality symbols

Literal equality ($=$), isomorphism ($\cong$), and equivalence ($\simeq$) are
written with distinct symbols. $\hookrightarrow$ denotes a stated inclusion,
embedding, or monomorphism; fullness, faithfulness, and repleteness are
asserted separately.

### `NOT-3`: One symbol, one meaning

The same symbol has the same type and meaning throughout the book. Project
notation is introduced at the defining occurrence, after the underlying
standard construction has been stated.

### `NOT-4`: Standard names

Use established names in their standard meanings: category of elements,
Grothendieck construction, core, arrow category, full subcategory, replete,
natural isomorphism, automorphism group, torsor, monoidal category, abelian
category, kernel, cokernel, discriminant form, genus, isometry, classifying
object. Do not coin a name for a notion that already has one.

## Properties and structure (`STR-*`)

### `STR-1`: Use the forgetful functor

For a specified forgetful functor $U\colon\mathcal S\to\mathcal C$, full
faithfulness gives at most property, faithfulness gives at most structure, and
an arbitrary functor gives at most stuff. Repleteness is a separate condition
when an essential image is replaced by a full subcategory.

### `STR-2`: Name every chosen structure

A structure on $X$ is a chosen object in the fiber over $X$ of a specified
forgetful functor. When several choices exist, name the one used by the
construction. For example, tensor product and direct sum give different
monoidal structures on modules.

### `STR-3`: State every hypothesis

A theorem states every object property, characteristic restriction, limit
assumption, flatness assumption, and equality of named morphisms used in its
conclusion. If a construction uses a basis, embedding, section, presentation,
or other witness, name that witness in the construction.

## Examples and presentation (`EX-*`)

### `EX-1`: An example mirrors the definition's form

An example instantiates each slot of the structure it exemplifies. If a
monoidal category was defined as a tuple
$(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, \mathbf{1}, \alpha, \lambda, \varrho)$, the example
presents the tuple: "Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category with finite products
and terminal object $e$. Then $(\mathcal{C}, \times, e)$ is a monoidal
category." The reader who just read the definition sees which slot is
which without parsing prose. Listing the components in a sentence instead
of presenting the tuple is readable but does not mirror the definition's
grammar.

**Banned:** "A category with finite products is monoidal with $a\otimes b$ a
chosen product $a\times b$ and $e$ a terminal object, the three isomorphisms
being the unique ones commuting with the projections; this is the cartesian
monoidal structure."

**Preferred:** "Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category with finite products and
terminal object $e$. Then $(\mathcal{C}, \times, e)$ is a monoidal category,
with associator and unitors the canonical isomorphisms supplied by the
universal property of the product."

### `EX-2`: An example is an example, not a proposition

If there is nothing to prove, do not present the passage as a proposition
with a proof. A category with finite products is an example of a monoidal
category, not a theorem. State the definition, then give the example in an
example block. Reserve proposition and proof blocks for statements that
require verification beyond unpacking the definition.

## Axioms and definitions (`AX-*`)

### `AX-1`: A definition that names axioms without stating them

A definition must fully determine the notion it introduces. Referencing
axioms by name — "satisfying the two hexagon conditions", "satisfying the
pentagon axiom" — without stating or drawing the diagrams is not a
definition. The reader cannot evaluate whether a given object satisfies the
definition, because the name of an axiom is not the axiom. State the
equations or draw the diagrams. If they are long, cite the exact diagrams
by reference to where they are written in full.

**Banned:** "A braiding on a monoidal category is a natural isomorphism
$\gamma_{a,b}\colon a\otimes b\cong b\otimes a$ satisfying the two hexagon
conditions relating $\gamma$ to $\alpha$."

**Preferred:** state or draw both hexagon diagrams. The definition names
each component and each axiom; the axioms are commutative diagrams, and a
definition either draws them or cites the exact reference where they are
written.

### `AX-2`: An axiom described by shape instead of by equation

"The hexagon conditions", "the pentagon axiom", "the triangle identities" —
the shape name is a mnemonic, not a mathematical condition. The condition
is a commutative diagram or an equation. Use the shape name alongside the
diagram, not in place of it. A reader who does not already know the shape
cannot reconstruct the axiom from its name.

**Banned:** "satisfying the two hexagon conditions relating $\gamma$ to
$\alpha$."

**Preferred:** draw the two hexagon diagrams, or write the equations they
commute. The name "hexagon" may appear as a label; it may not substitute
for the diagram.

### `AX-3`: "relating" an axiom to its components without stating the relation

"relating $\gamma$ to $\alpha$", "commuting with the projections",
"compatible with the tensor product" — each names a relationship without
stating the equation or diagram that expresses it. A definition or theorem
that invokes a relation states the relation: the commutative diagram, the
equation, or the naturality square. "Relating" and "compatible" gesture at
a mathematical statement that is not written.

**Banned:** "satisfying the two hexagon conditions relating $\gamma$ to
$\alpha$."

**Preferred:** state the relation — the hexagon diagrams express that
specific composites of $\gamma$, $\alpha$, and the tensor product's
functoriality are equal. Draw the diagrams or write the equations.

### `AX-4`: A definition that is not self-contained

A definition must be evaluable from the text plus its cited references. A
definition that references axioms by name without stating them and without
citing where they are written in full gives the reader neither the axioms
nor a pointer. The reader cannot determine whether a given object satisfies
the definition. Self-contained does not mean everything is derived from
first principles in one sentence — it means the text or its cited
references supply every component the definition requires.

**Banned:** "A braiding on a monoidal category is a natural isomorphism
$\gamma_{a,b}\colon a\otimes b\cong b\otimes a$ satisfying the two hexagon
conditions relating $\gamma$ to $\alpha$." No diagrams, no citation.

**Preferred:** draw the hexagon diagrams in the definition, or write
"[@MacLane, Chapter VII, (2.1) and (2.2)]" citing the exact diagrams. The
reader follows the citation and finds the axioms; or the reader reads the
diagrams in the text. Either way the definition is evaluable.

### `AX-5`: An axiom named by count without stating or citing the axioms

"The two hexagon conditions", "the three coherence axioms", "the five
simplicial identities" — a count of axioms without stating or citing them
combines AX-1 and AX-2 with a cardinality label. The count tells the reader
how many axioms to imagine without supplying them. Name each axiom, draw
each diagram, or cite the exact reference for all of them. The count is not
a substitute.

**Banned:** "satisfying the two hexagon conditions."

**Preferred:** draw both hexagon diagrams, or cite the reference where both
are written. The reader does not need to be told there are two; the reader
needs to see them.

## Terminology (`TERM-*`)

Use established mathematical terms in their standard meanings. Do not coin a
name for a notion that already has one. Do not import a term from another
field where the book owes a standard mathematical object. Do not overload a
standard word with a project-management or implementation meaning.

Terminology failures have three recurring forms:

- **Foreign-discipline substitution.** A technical term from another field is
  used where the book owes a standard mathematical object and definition.
- **Project coinage.** An undefined word is made to do mathematical work.
- **Colliding overload.** A standard word such as "kernel", "core", or
  "fiber" is reused with a project-management or implementation meaning.

The citation-backed recurring inventory lives in
`.agents/references/terminology-dictionary.md`. The following replacements
apply to this book:

| Term to avoid | Required mathematical statement |
| --- | --- |
| ontology | a specified functor, strict 2-functor, or pseudofunctor into $\mathbf{Cat}$; say *presentation of a category or 2-category by generators and relations* only after specifying those generators, relations, and closure operations |
| project lexicon | the defined categories, functors, predicates, and constructions, each with its type |
| corpus, when used for a generated object | the generated sub-2-category |
| graph or tree, when used for the whole object | a specified functor $I\to\mathbf{Cat}$, or a specified strict 2-functor or pseudofunctor $\mathcal I\to\mathbf{Cat}$; for a finite indexing poset $I$, say *tree-shaped* only when its undirected Hasse diagram is connected and acyclic |
| node | category or object, whichever is meant |
| edge | functor or morphism, whichever is meant |
| seed | generator |
| constructor | the named categorical construction or 2-functor |
| cut or axiom cut | a replete full subcategory defined by an object property, or a specified forgetful functor from structured objects |
| cut owner | the category whose objects satisfy the property, or the domain of the forgetful functor |
| cut instantiation | for $F\colon\mathcal D\to\mathcal C$ and a full subcategory $\mathcal C_P\hookrightarrow\mathcal C$, the full subcategory of $\mathcal D$ on objects $D$ satisfying $P(FD)$; or the pullback of $p\colon E\to B$ along a named map $f\colon X\to B$ |
| implication edge | the inclusion induced by a stated implication, with its proof |
| generation rule or square | the pullback of a replete full subcategory along a functor |
| minimal graph | an inclusion-minimal generating subdiagram relative to stated targets, permitted closure operations, and a specified equivalence relation on the class of presentations; uniqueness is a separate claim |
| Level-0 generic | the general construction and the parameter choice producing the instance |
| operation home | the domain, codomain, and type of the functor, natural transformation, object property, invariant, or operation |
| route | a composite or factorization of functors |
| preferred route or preferred functor | a distinguished functor or factorization with comparison maps, or an implementation dispatch policy confined to an implementation page |
| routing diamond | a commutative square, strictly or up to a specified natural isomorphism |
| tether or alignment | the specified equality, isomorphism, equivalence, natural isomorphism, or factorization |
| realization functor | the actual functor with source and target; use *forgetful functor* only when structure is forgotten and *realization* only for a defined realization construction |
| witness-level datum | the chosen basis, enumeration, presentation, section, or other auxiliary datum |
| free or torsion fiber | for a named functor $F\colon\mathcal D\to\mathcal C$, the full subcategory of $\mathcal D$ on objects mapped into the specified free or torsion full subcategory of $\mathcal C$; add finiteness only when it is a hypothesis |
| unified O | for an ordinary category $\mathcal C$, $\operatorname{Aut}\colon\mathcal C^{\simeq}\to\mathbf{Grp}$, with $O(X):=\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ as an instance |
| homsets-as-parents | the hom-bifunctor, the core groupoid, or $\operatorname{Iso}_{\mathcal C}(X,Y)$, which is a bitorsor under $\operatorname{Aut}(Y)$ on the left and $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ on the right when $X\cong Y$ |
| residue | the missing definition or unformalized theorem |
| gap row | a documented missing formalization; this already has a precise implementation meaning |
| Synthetic layer | a provisional axiomatization, with its axioms and conjectures declared |
| base of an axiom | the property or structure and the category whose objects satisfy or support it; for a classifying fibration, its domain, codomain, and universal property |
| transport of an axiom | the pullback of the specified family along the named functor, when that family and its universal property have been defined |
| owned at or ownership, when used mathematically | the property of objects of the named category, or a chosen structured object in the fiber of a specified forgetful functor |

### `TERM-1`: Retired substitutions

These terms survived one round of editing and are withdrawn.

**Banned:** "multi-sorted signature"; "semantic interpretation"; "executable
interpretation"; Mathlib identifiers used as prose nouns.

**Preferred:** state the actual categories, functors, predicates, and
constructions. Name the mathematical functor or the implementation operation
actually meant. Restrict Mathlib identifiers to code-formatted implementation
anchors.

## Parentheticals (`PAR-*`)

A semantic parenthetical is a compression. Prefer expansion over compression:
expanding into explicit mathematics is reversible, whereas a compression is
lossy and usually smuggles an undefined term or an unstated theorem.

### `PAR-1`: Compression artifact

Terse to the point of inscrutability, standing in for a notion that needs
spelling out.

**Banned:** "weak homotopy equivalence (holds; inverts/ignores
directionality) versus categorical equivalence (fails; preserves it)."

**Preferred:** expand into prose or a definition that states the
distinction.

### `PAR-2`: Smuggled theorem or equivalence

"(equivalently, $X$)", an "iff" asserted in a parenthesis, often over
undefined terms.

**Banned:** "full and faithful (equivalently, a replete full subcategory)"
— a functor is identified with its essential image and an equivalence is
asserted aside.

**Preferred:** "If $F\colon\mathcal C\to\mathcal D$ is fully faithful, then
$F$ induces an equivalence from $\mathcal C$ to its replete full essential
image in $\mathcal D$." Cite the result and define any term not already
established. The expanded statement can later be demoted to a remark, cited
theorem, or footnote.

### `PAR-3`: Smuggled example

"(e.g. …)" carrying a genuine example.

**Banned:** "several distinct lifts (e.g. several monoidal structures on one
category)."

**Preferred:** promote to a first-class example block.

### `PAR-4`: Legitimate qualification

A small, correct, load-bearing modifier. Keep inline.

**Fine as is:** "fibers are (possibly nontrivial) groupoids."

### `PAR-5`: Padding or tangent

Carries no load.

**Preferred:** delete. A parenthetical is usually wrong when it is a
tangent.

## Not flags

Standard mathematical hedging and signposting that carry real content are not
violations: "provided", "up to isomorphism", "without loss of generality", a
genuine sign or normalization convention, and a Remark that explains a real
subtlety in context. The test is whether removing the phrase removes
information. A tagline removes none.

## Symbols and binding (`SYM-*`)

### `SYM-1`: A symbol used without being bound

A passage uses $\mu$, $\eta$, or another symbol without introducing the
object it names. No underlying object is stated, no domain or codomain is
given, and the reader cannot determine what the symbol refers to without
external knowledge. State the data first: name the object, its type, and the
map's domain and codomain. Then use the symbol.

**Banned:** "A monoid in $(\mathbf{Ab},\otimes_{\mathbb Z},\mathbb Z)$ is a
ring, its multiplication being the bilinear map classified by $\mu$ and its
unit the image of $1$ under $\eta$." The symbols $\mu$ and $\eta$ are used
without being introduced; no abelian group $A$ is named; no domains or
codomains are stated.

**Preferred:** "A monoid object in
$(\mathbf{Ab},\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}},\mathbb{Z})$ is a triple
$(A,\mu,\eta)$ where $A$ is an abelian group,
$\mu\colon A\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}A\to A$ is a homomorphism, and
$\eta\colon\mathbb{Z}\to A$ is a homomorphism. The bilinear multiplication
$A\times A\to A$ is the map corresponding to $\mu$ under the tensor-hom
adjunction, and the unit element is $\eta(1)$." Name the data, then use the
symbols.

### `SYM-2`: Data referenced by role instead of by declaration

A passage refers to "the multiplication", "the unit", "the associator", or
"the classifying map" without first declaring the object that plays that
role. The role name presupposes the data without stating it. Declare the
data — the map, its domain, its codomain — then refer to it by name. A role
description is a comment on data that has been stated, not a substitute for
stating it.

**Banned:** "its multiplication being the bilinear map classified by $\mu$"
— "the multiplication" is a role; $\mu$ is undeclared; "the bilinear map
classified by $\mu$" describes what $\mu$ does without stating what $\mu$
is.

**Preferred:** "$\mu\colon A\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}A\to A$ is a homomorphism;
the corresponding bilinear map $A\times A\to A$ is the multiplication."
Declare the map, then name its role.
