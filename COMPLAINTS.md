# Foundational Gaps and Papercuts

Record unresolved issues observed anywhere in research or contribution work.
The primary subject is general mathematical machinery that should be available but is missing, incomplete, or bypassed in the owned language.
Concrete workflow papercuts also belong here.
This is neither a retrospective work log nor a list of hypothetical defects.

Use the [mathematical tracing method](CONTRIBUTING.md#mathematical-dependency-tracing) and the capture/lifecycle rule [`DEV-59`](CONTRIBUTING.md#dev-59-record-observed-foundational-gaps-and-papercuts).
State the mathematics before its implementation symptoms.
Extend an existing entry when another consumer exposes the same foundation.
Link execution details in [TODO.md](TODO.md); it owns implementation ordering under the single-worker `DEV-61` rule.
Remove resolved entries with evidence in the commit, retaining only unfinished needs and any required terminal verification.
Durable definitions and decisions belong at their mathematical declarations or in CONTRIBUTING, not solely here.

## Foundational Mathematics

### Set-theoretic behaviour is re-implemented instead of wired to a set engine

A set is determined by its membership condition. A finite set of listed points
decides membership by the points' identity; a set given by a predicate decides
it by the predicate; the image of a map decides it by an inverse or an inverse
image. An enumeration is a further chosen datum -- a bijection from an ordinal
onto the set -- which supplies order and rank and never decides membership.
Maintained engines already implement each of these: Sage's `Set` (a hashed
`frozenset`), `ConditionSet`, `ImageSubobject`, `cartesian_product`,
`DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets`, `Subsets`, `FiniteSetMaps`, `IntegerRange`,
`NonNegativeIntegers`; SymPy's `FiniteSet`, `ConditionSet`, `ImageSet`; GAP's
collections.

The preamble's set layer (`categories/sets/set_categories.py`,
`categories/sets/finite_ordered_sets.py`) instead builds every finite set as an
index set plus position/point lambdas and derived membership by comparing a
candidate with every point. Observed on 2026-09-23: framing labels are SR
symbols, each comparison is a symbolic proof attempt, and the star import took
460 s (a rank-8 lattice took 3.3 s, growing cubically). `from_indexed` now
defaults to Sage's hashed `Set` and a hash map for positions (`77b05adb`), and
product points keep their components (`cfc27a51`); the rest of the layer still
hand-rolls what the engines above compute:

| Owned construction | Membership now | Engine that computes it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_ImageSet` | inverse, or `Set` of the values for a finite source | `ImageSubobject(map, domain, inverse=...)` |
| `CartesianProductsOfSets` | category default; points rebuilt through factor constructors | `cartesian_product` |
| `CoproductsOfSets` | parent identity | `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` |
| `PowerSets`, `FixedCardinalitySubsetSets`, `FinitePowerSets` | hand-written through subobject placement (iteration already uses `Subsets`) | `Subsets(X)`, `Subsets(X, k)` |
| `FunctionSets` | membership in the owned Mor | `FiniteSetMaps(X, Y)` |
| `_ConditionSet` | the predicate (correct in shape) | `ConditionSet(universe, predicate)` |
| `FiniteOrdinalSets`, `NN` | bounds checks (correct in shape) | `IntegerRange(n)`, `NonNegativeIntegers()` |

The set layer is one instance. The same afternoon found an owned matrix
algebra, with its tensor-algebra framing, built for every lattice in order to
take one determinant (now Sage's matrix determinant, `_gram_determinant`), a
real-number relation decided by Maxima's `simplify_full` before `AA` or Arb
were tried (`rings/real.py`), and each Gram entry re-derived by building and
expanding a pure tensor. The general need is that owned objects keep public
mathematics owned and route computation through a maintained engine
privately (`OWN-06`); where the preamble re-rolls an engine's behaviour, the
owned code is a second, slower, less correct implementation.

**Consumers:** every framed module (framing labels), tensor products (pair
labels), lattices and forms (Gram entries), catalogues, and every membership
test in construction admission.
**Coverage boundary:** the set layer's constructions were read; other layers
were found only where profiling of the star import led. The audit of the
whole preamble for engine behaviour re-implemented locally is the TODO node
`engine-wiring-audit`.
## Workflow Papercuts

Add concrete observed workflow friction here under a descriptive heading, with the user action, expected behavior, actual result, owning boundary and example.
Use `DEV-59` for capture and resolution.
Foundational mathematical gaps belong above even when first noticed as an inconvenient method or notebook interaction.
